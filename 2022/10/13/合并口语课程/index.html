<p>Well, firstly, it must be pointed out that the transport systems in China have improved significantly<code> /sɪɡˈnɪf.ɪ.kənt.li/</code> in the past decades.

Now we have high-speed trains with great facilities - they’re spotlessly clean and amazingly efficient. What I would improve, however, are the buses.

Volleyball is a popular team sport where two teams of 6 players on each team are either side of a tall net. It’s a bite like a tennis net, but it’s much higher than head height. Like most sports, the detailed rules are quite complicated, but simply put, the players should attempt to hit the ball over the net with their hands and keep a rally going, back and forth, without the ball touching the floor. Players are not allowed to catch the ball and the ball must not touch the net.</p>
<h5 id="Bullet-point-2"><a href="#Bullet-point-2" class="headerlink" title="Bullet point 2"></a>Bullet point 2</h5><p>Well, <strong>I first heard about volleyball from</strong> some classmates, <strong>and I remember seeing a game</strong> on television. <strong>I first played it, however,</strong> many years later, on the beach with some friends on holiday.

It was a wonderful relaxing resort set in the heart of a place of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/astounding">astounding</a><code>/əˈstaʊn.dɪŋ/</code> natural beauty. The building itself was in the style of an ancient wooden <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/buddhist?q=Buddhist+">Buddhist</a><code> /ˈbʊd.ɪst/</code> temple, with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/decorative">decorative</a><code>/ˈdek.ər.ə.tɪv/</code>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/eaves">eaves</a> <code> /ivz/</code> and peaceful, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/exquisitely">exquisitely</a> <code>/ɪkˈskwɪz.ɪt.li/</code> landscaped gardens.

<p>Most of the time we spent just relaxing and enjoying the facilities in the resort. But one thing that really <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/stand-out">stands out</a> in my mind is when we went exploring the local area.

<h3 id="Example-Answer-5"><a href="#Example-Answer-5" class="headerlink" title="Example Answer"></a>Example Answer</h3><p>I’d like to talk about the washing machine. It has really revolutionized life in the home. Washing machines are basically large, white metal boxes that you put in the kitchen or the bathroom, and are used for washing clothes and fabrics like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/bed-sheet?q=bedsheet">bedsheets</a><code>/ˈbed ʃiːt/</code>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/pillowcase?q=pillowcases">pillow-cases</a><code>/ˈpɪl.əʊ.keɪs/</code> or even curtains. Put simply, you load the clothes into the machine, pull out a small plastic tray in the front and fill it wish washing liquid, and then on an electronic panel you set the temperature, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/duration">duration</a><code> /djʊəˈreɪ.ʃən/</code> of the wash and speed, then press ‘start’. The machine pumps hot water into the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/barrel">barrel</a><code> /ˈbær.əl/</code> which goes round and round washing the clothes inside. In the end, it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/drain?q=drains">drains</a><code> /dreɪn/</code> the water and dries with clothes by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/spin?q=Spin">spinning</a><code> /spɪn/</code> them at a high temperature.</p>
<p>It has made life easier by saving people a lot of time and energy in the home. By relieving people of the difficult, time-consuming and messy task of washing and drying clothes, people have more time to focus on other things - like spending time with family, or reading or engaging in more <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/stimulating">stimulating</a><code> /ˈstɪm.jə.leɪ.tɪŋ/</code> and rewarding pursuits.</p>
<p>We are all so used to having washing machines in the home, we couldn’t live without them! If we did not have washing machines, I don’t know how we would survive! <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/domestic?q=Domestic">Domestic</a><code> /dəˈmes.tɪk/</code> life would be much more of a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/chore">chore</a><code>/tʃɔːr/</code>, and a lot of more tiring!</p>

<p>The examiner say:</p>
<p>Now, we’ve been talking about an old object in your family, I’d like to ask you one or two more general questions about this…</p>
<p>First lets discuss… <strong>Memories and family history</strong></p>
<h2 id="How-important-is-it-that-we-keep-objects-to-remember-our-family’s-past"><a href="#How-important-is-it-that-we-keep-objects-to-remember-our-family’s-past" class="headerlink" title="How important is it that we keep objects to remember our family’s past?"></a>How important is it that we keep objects to remember our family’s past?</h2><p>I think it’s credibly important that people keep <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/memento?q=mementoes">mementoes</a> <code>/məˈmen.təʊ/</code> in their family.

Above all, I think it’s necessary for children to understand the value of family so they can promote positive values to their families in the future. Heirlooms can be excellent way to remember people and special occasions we have shared.</p>

I think that putting our parents into a home when they are old should be a last resort - we should only do it if we are not in a position to look after them ourselves.</p>

Things have moved forward at a lightening speed. When I was in school almost nobody had mobile phones (about 20 years ago, or so), and when they started to become more common they were simple and used only for making quick calls. Now, cellphones are like small powerful computers. There are loads of additional features beyond just being able to make calls - including top of the range built-in cameras, photo-editing software, voice messaging and online games. Battery life is much longer than before, and they are much easier to carry around. In fact, they are much slicker, cooler and more fashionable today than they were when they first came out.</p>

As soon as you arrive in a city, you’re struck by how much activity there is -all going on around you- in contrast to country towns, that are generally peaceful, relaxing and calm. Cities, however, provide many more opportunities to get involved in cultural activities, like theater, cinema and the arts, as well as sports. Cities also offer more <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/term?q=in+terms+of">in terms of</a> job opportunities and chances to develop in a career.

I think maybe the authorities think everyone has a laptop so they don’t bother to upgrade the computers on campus. But this is unfair on the lower income students. I think they should improve the computers in the library by creating a modern, dedicated IT center. Secondly, our creative thinking skills are a little behind some countries especially in arts-based subjects, so we need to learn more discussion and debate skills and we should be given more opportunities to see issues from multiple viewpoints and discuss them in seminars, workshops and assignments.</p>

I recently read an article about space tourism, actually. I think it is very likely that space travel will become a popular activity for people in the future. There are lots of wealthy people who are already paying money to travel into space, so I think that within a few years people will be making regular trips into space - sort of like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/excursion?q=excursions">excursions</a><code> /ɪkˈskɜː.ʃən/</code>. Also, as the earth is becoming over-populated, there is little doubt that we need to explore space and start to develop technologies that will enable us to inhabit other planets. I think it’s pretty unlikely that we will do this within a few years, but I believe it is highly probable that within a few decades we will see the first human colonies on Mars.</p>

<ul>
<li>I believe that the most important <strong>inventions</strong> this century <strong>are those relating to</strong> communications technologies.</li>
<li>I think that the most significant <strong>developments</strong> in our time <strong>are those to do with</strong> environmental technologies.</li>
<li>The main <strong>technologies</strong> that will impact our lives in the future <strong>are those that will contribute to</strong> environmental improvements.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>it, this, that, they, these, those</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Technology companies are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/continually">continually</a><code>/kənˈtɪn.ju.ə.li/</code> developing</strong> to stay <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/ahead-of">ahead of</a> the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/competition">competition</a><code>/ˌkɒm.pəˈtɪʃ.ən/</code>. <strong>This</strong> means that they must keep investing in research.</p>
<p>Most people think that <strong>space travel</strong> will be <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/commonplace">commonplace</a><code> /ˈkɒm.ən.pleɪs/</code> in the future. However, I think <strong>it’s</strong> something that will only be popular amongst the wealthy. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/millionaire?q=Millionaires">Millionaires</a><code>/ˌmɪl.jəˈneər/</code> like Elon Musk and Richard Branson are investing a lot in space tourism. <strong>That’s</strong> why I believe that there is a strong possibility that we will see excursions into outer space in the near future.</p>
<p>Many people say that <strong>this</strong> is a waste of money and they should invest in medical care and environmental technologies instead. <strong>Such</strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/criticism">criticism</a><code> /ˈkrɪt.ɪ.sɪ.zəm/</code> are quite common today - especially with all the environmental concerns.</p>
<p>Many people believe that teaching creativity and critical thinking in schools will help us become increasingly innovative in the future. <strong>These qualities</strong> are considered to be essential in today’s educational institutions.</p>
<p>Well, there are a lot of technologies that will impact the future: the advancement of robotics, communication technologies, and <strong>those</strong> related to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/sustainable?q=+sustainable">sustainable</a><code>/səˈsteɪ.nə.bəl/</code> development and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/alternative">alternative</a><code>/ɒlˈtɜː.nə.tɪv/ </code> energy. All <strong>these</strong> innovations will have a big influence on our societies in the coming years.</p>

<p>Those &#x3D; more general</p>
<p>These &#x3D; more specific, just specifically mentioned.</p>

<p>so I think that within a few years people <strong>will be making</strong> regular trips into space - sort of like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/excursion?q=excursions">excursions</a><code> /ɪkˈskɜː.ʃən/</code>. </p>
<p><strong>there is little doubt that</strong> we need to explore space and start to develop technologies <strong>that will enable us to</strong> inhabit other planets.</p>
<p>I think it’s <strong>pretty unlikely that we will do this</strong> within a few years.</p>
<p>but I believe it is <strong>highly probable that</strong> within a few decades we will see the first human colonies on Mars.</p>

I think it requires some specialist subject knowledge to reach a proper conclusion. However, I tend to disagree that spending lots of money on space exploration is worthwhile. I am really unsure whether or not it is a good idea to invest so much in something like this when there are serious problems for countries on earth that need to be addressed - like medical care, hospitals and poverty. It’s difficult to say I completely disagree but, my feelings are that it should not be top priority for a country until other major issues have been dealt with first. On the other hand, I can see why countries might want to be ambitious and keep exploring space - often discoveries in outer space can have great benefits for humankind on earth…</p>
