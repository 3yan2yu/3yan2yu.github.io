<li>Governments should <strong>ensure all communities have access to</strong> separated-waste <strong>disposal points</strong> and appoint some people to instruct how to deal with waste reasonably. </li>
<li>Scientists can <strong>develop new energy&#x2F;electricity-powered cars&#x2F;vehicles.</strong> In addition, they can build <strong>lab-grown</strong> or <strong>plant-based meat</strong> to reduce pollution <strong>caused by animal husbandry.</strong></li>
<li>Governments can invest in <strong>cleaner resources</strong> such as <strong>wind, solar and wave power.</strong> </li>
<li>People can choose <strong>low-carbon travel</strong>, such as riding, public transport and electricity-power vehicles.</li>
<li>Schools can <strong>raise awareness of the younger generation</strong> by holding some activities, such as planting trees and picking up bottles in the parks.</li>

<li>Animals are <strong>a necessary tool</strong> <strong>in modern medical research</strong>. What’s more, they also are <strong>the effective models of human body.</strong></li>
<li>Animals efficiently <strong>measure new medicine’s effectiveness</strong>, enabling <strong>the research and development</strong> of new <strong>medical treatments.</strong></li>
<li>Animals help scientists to <strong>get a deeper understanding of human biology</strong> and to <strong>make significant medical breakthroughs</strong>. For example, <strong>the vaccination for smallpox</strong> and <strong>organ transplantation</strong> have enabled advances <strong>in many critical medical areas.</strong> </li>
<li>Scientists haven’t developed <strong>equally sophisticated substitutes</strong>, so the ban on testing new medicine on animals can <strong>impede understanding of human biology and health.</strong></li>
<li>Some experiments are essential because they <strong>lead to significant medical breakthroughs</strong>. For example, new vaccination tests on animals <strong>play a vital part</strong> in the fight against COVID-19. In addition, animal trials make progress in <strong>drug production</strong> to help people with <strong>dementia and cancer.</strong> Therefore, if animal experiments were banned, we would have <strong>faced the problem of</strong> <strong>how to test these new medical ideas.</strong> Seldom people would like to <strong>volunteer for</strong> this <strong>hazardous role</strong>.</li>
<li>We can <strong>treat</strong> these animals <strong>in human ways</strong> when conducting experiments, <strong>minimising the pain experienced by animals.</strong></li>
<li>Animals are <strong>an integral part of</strong> the global diet and <strong>a significant source of</strong> minerals and proteins.</li>
<li>Animals provide <strong>valuable protein sources</strong>, such as eggs, meats and milk, and most people can not survive without these proteins.</li>
<li>Nutrition from meat can <strong>be difficult to obtain from plants.</strong></li>
<li>People <strong>rely on animal skin for leather</strong>, providing shoes and clothes.</li>
<li>Feathers are <strong>a valuable component</strong> of bedding and clothes, such as pillows and duvets, helping people <strong>in icy regions withstand cold.</strong> </li>
<li>Extinction is <strong>part of the evolution</strong> and <strong>natural process</strong>, which would happen <strong>with or without humans</strong>. Besides, <strong>the cost involved in saving endangered animal species</strong> is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/prohibitive">prohibitive</a>.</li>

<h4 id="Reasons-for-Not-Using-Animals"><a href="#Reasons-for-Not-Using-Animals" class="headerlink" title="Reasons for Not Using Animals"></a>Reasons for Not Using Animals</h4><ol>
<li>Animals suffer and die <strong>under cruel conditions</strong> for our benefit. </li>
<li>Animal experiments <strong>are cruel and immoral</strong>, leading to considerable suffering or death for animals.</li>
<li>Humankind <strong>has no right to</strong> subject animals to pain and suffering. </li>
<li>Animals could <strong>be identified as companions</strong> for humans, such as dogs and cats.</li>
<li>Several animals are friends of humankind, such as dogs, cats and parrots.</li>
<li>People find animals interesting and enjoyable.</li>
<li>Watching animals in their natural habitat is relaxing and entertaining.</li>
<li>Animals have great value for people as pets, especially those who have lost loved ones, do not have children, or even are suffering from mental health.</li>

<li><p>Playing or caressing with pets reduces levels of stress in humans.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keeping pets is a suitable method for children to learn about animals and how to care for them appropriately. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Not using animals can reduce or eliminate the need to unnecessarily harm animals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The importance of Animals’ security and health should be given priority over people’s leisure preferences.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Humans can obtain nutrients from lab-grown meat and artificial meat made of soybeans.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Manufactured products can replace furs from animals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scientists should not use animals to test new drugs because humans and animals may react differently to the medication. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Studying their behaviour and how they learn can be very interesting and teach us more about ourselves.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Human has directly caused and is causing much of this extinction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If humans do not save endangered animals, we will lead to biodiversity loss and an imbalance in our ecosystems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Human activities can result in habitats being destroyed for some animals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Maintaining biodiversity is critical for a healthy ecological system.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><p>Balanced ecosystems ensure that humans have clear air, water, and fertile land.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Humans can include animals in captive breeding programmers to improve their numbers. When the habitats have recovered or been replaced, animals can be gradually and carefully reintroduced.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Languages are a proven track record by which we can separate ourselves from the rest of the species.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Languages not only provide a sense of identity and belonging but are symbols of differentiating national identities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Languages are a  way of thinking and the wealth of wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Old buildings remind people the past achievements or losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Languages are carriers of culture. In addition, they are part of a country’s heritage.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><p>Languages are closely intertwined with civilisation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Languages play a crucial role in maintaining and reinforcing a nation’s identity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The extinction of endangered languages makes archaeologists and historians fail to research corresponding cultures.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protecting old buildings may enhance culture diversity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Historical buildings act as tourist attractions to bring more capital to the local government.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Historical buildings having cultural features can attract tourists, promoting local economic development.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Old buildings reveal the process of human development.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Antique building craft and materials would have research values.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protecting old buildings, the ultimate form of recycling, saves energy on manufacturing and transporting building materials and tools and reduces construction waste and the need for new materials.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A way of life may disappear with a language vanishing. Moreover, cultural homogeneity will render the world tedious.</p>
