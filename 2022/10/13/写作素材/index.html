<li>Animals are <strong>a necessary tool</strong> <strong>in modern medical research</strong>. What’s more, they also are <strong>the effective models of human body.</strong></li>
<li>Animals efficiently <strong>measure new medicine’s effectiveness</strong>, enabling <strong>the research and development</strong> of new <strong>medical treatments.</strong></li>
<li>Animals help scientists to <strong>get a deeper understanding of human biology</strong> and to <strong>make significant medical breakthroughs</strong>. For example, <strong>the vaccination for smallpox</strong> and <strong>organ transplantation</strong> have enabled advances <strong>in many critical medical areas.</strong> </li>
<li>Scientists haven’t developed <strong>equally sophisticated substitutes</strong>, so the ban on testing new medicine on animals can <strong>impede understanding of human biology and health.</strong></li>
<li>Some experiments are essential because they <strong>lead to significant medical breakthroughs</strong>. For example, new vaccination tests on animals <strong>play a vital part</strong> in the fight against COVID-19. In addition, animal trials make progress in <strong>drug production</strong> to help people with <strong>dementia and cancer.</strong> Therefore, if animal experiments were banned, we would have <strong>faced the problem of</strong> <strong>how to test these new medical ideas.</strong> Seldom people would like to <strong>volunteer for</strong> this <strong>hazardous role</strong>.</li>
<li>We can <strong>treat</strong> these animals <strong>in human ways</strong> when conducting experiments, <strong>minimising the pain experienced by animals.</strong></li>
<li>Animals are <strong>an integral part of</strong> the global diet and <strong>a significant source of</strong> minerals and proteins.</li>
<li>Animals provide <strong>valuable protein sources</strong>, such as eggs, meats and milk, and most people can not survive without these proteins.</li>
<li>Nutrition from meat can <strong>be difficult to obtain from plants.</strong></li>
<li>People <strong>rely on animal skin for leather</strong>, providing shoes and clothes.</li>
<li>Feathers are <strong>a valuable component</strong> of bedding and clothes, such as pillows and duvets, helping people <strong>in icy regions withstand cold.</strong> </li>
<li>Extinction is <strong>part of the evolution</strong> and <strong>natural process</strong>, which would happen <strong>with or without humans</strong>. Besides, <strong>the cost involved in saving endangered animal species</strong> is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/prohibitive">prohibitive</a>.</li>

<h4 id="Reasons-for-Not-Using-Animals"><a href="#Reasons-for-Not-Using-Animals" class="headerlink" title="Reasons for Not Using Animals"></a>Reasons for Not Using Animals</h4><ol>
<li><p>Animals suffer and die <strong>under cruel conditions</strong> for our benefit. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Animal experiments <strong>are cruel and immoral</strong>, leading to considerable suffering or death for animals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Humankind <strong>has no right to</strong> subject animals to pain and suffering. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Animals could <strong>be identified as companions</strong> for humans, such as dogs and cats.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Several animals are <strong>friends of humankind</strong>, such as dogs, cats and parrots.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People find animals <strong>interesting and enjoyable</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Watching animals <strong>in their natural habitat</strong> is relaxing and entertaining.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Animals have <strong>great value</strong> for people as pets, especially those who have lost loved ones, do not have children, or even are <strong>suffering from mental health.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Playing or caressing with pets <strong>reduces levels of stress</strong> in humans.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keeping pets is <strong>a suitable method for</strong> children to <strong>learn about animals</strong> and <strong>how to care for them appropriately.</strong> </p>
</li>
<li><p>Not using animals can <strong>reduce or eliminate the need to</strong> unnecessarily harm animals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The importance of Animals’ security and health should <strong>be given priority over</strong> people’s leisure preferences.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Humans can obtain nutrients from <strong>lab-grown meat</strong> and <strong>artificial meat made of soybeans.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Manufactured products</strong> can replace furs from animals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scientists should not use animals to test new drugs because humans and animals may <strong>react differently to the medication.</strong> </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Studying their behaviour</strong> and how they learn can be very interesting and teach us more about ourselves.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Human has directly caused and is causing much of this extinction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If humans do not save endangered animals, we will lead to <strong>biodiversity loss</strong> and an <strong>imbalance in our ecosystems.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Human activities can result in <strong>habitats being destroyed</strong> for some animals.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Maintaining biodiversity</strong> is critical for <strong>a healthy ecological system.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>The extinction of animals can result in the <strong>overpopulation of other species</strong>, disrupting the <strong>whole food chain.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Balanced ecosystems</strong> ensure that humans have <strong>clear air, water, and fertile land.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Humans can include animals in <strong>captive breeding programmers</strong> to improve their numbers. When the habitats have recovered or been replaced, animals can <strong>be gradually and carefully reintroduced.</strong></p>
