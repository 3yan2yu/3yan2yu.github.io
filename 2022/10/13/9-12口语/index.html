<p>Focusing on assignments<code> /əˈsaɪn.mənt/</code> or projects is vital<code> /ˈvaɪ.təl/</code> to all graduating<code> /ˈɡrædʒ.u.eɪt/</code> students since they need to pass their courses<code> /kɔːs/</code> to get the diploma<code>/dɪˈpləʊ.mə/</code>. As one of them, I usually go to peaceful settings such libraries or cafes<code> /ˈkæf.eɪ/</code>. Moreover, I turn off my mobile phone to avoid<code> /əˈvɔɪd/</code> distraction<code> /dɪˈstræk.ʃən/</code>. In addition<code> /əˈdɪʃ.ən/</code>, I practice having a healthy lifestyle to balance my mental and physical well-being.

<p>Answer  structure: Example + Description + Reason</p>
<p>I used to eat many snacks<code> /snæk/sinakesi</code> when I was a child such jelly<code>/ˈdʒel.i/</code>, chocolate, melon<code> /ˈmel.ən/</code> seeds and peanuts<code> /ˈpiː.nʌt/</code>. Among all these foods, I like melon seeds best. Melon seeds are full of health benefits<code>/ˈben.ɪ.fɪt/beineifeita</code> and it’s a source of protein<code> /ˈprəʊ.tiːn/puroutin</code>. What’s more, it’s satisfying<code> /ˈsæt.ɪs.faɪ.ɪŋ/sateisifaiying</code> to eat because of its taste<code> /teɪst/</code>, and it’s crispy<code>/ˈkrɪs.pi/</code> when it’s roasted<code>/rəʊst/</code>. I normally enjoy chewing<code>/tʃuː/chuying</code> it while watching TV.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-often-eat-snacks-when-you-were-young"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-often-eat-snacks-when-you-were-young" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Do you often eat snacks when you were young?"></a>Part 1 - Do you often eat snacks when you were young?</h3><p>As what I mentioned before, there were several<code> /ˈsev.ər.əl/</code> snacks that I normally eat when I was young. I always eat them with my friends after class every day when I was still in grade school. We used to share our snacks to each other so that we can consume more foods during recess<code> /rɪˈses/</code>. As a result, I no longer had an appetite<code> /ˈæp.ə.taɪt/apeitaite</code> to ingest<code> /ɪnˈdʒest/</code> my regular<code> /ˈreɡ.jə.lər/</code> meals with my family, so my dad didn’t allow me to eat more snacks since then.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-When-do-you-usually-eat-snacks-now"><a href="#Part-1-When-do-you-usually-eat-snacks-now" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - When do you usually eat snacks now?"></a>Part 1 - When do you usually eat snacks now?</h3><p>I eat less now compared<code> /kəmˈpeər/</code> before. Currently, I have a healthier eating habit. Having regular meals give me enough energy to get through the day, so I seldom eat snacks. However, when my friends buy some light meals and they share them with me, I just eat a little. Besides, I seem to lose interest in snacks although I have more chance and money to buy them. I think it’s better to go to a restaurant because they serve<code> /sɜːv/</code> delicious foods.</p>
<p>However, sometimes my friends and I eat China skewers at food booths set up along both sides of the street. It’s a pleasure to grab skewers filled with lamb, beef, chicken wings or vegetables on the road on a summer night.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-think-it-is-healthy-for-you-to-eat-snacks"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-think-it-is-healthy-for-you-to-eat-snacks" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Do you think it is healthy for you to eat snacks?"></a>Part 1 - Do you think it is healthy for you to eat snacks?</h3><p>Maybe it’s not healthy to eat snacks because some may contain chemical<code>/ˈkem.ɪ.kəl/</code> ingredients to enhance their flavor, and there are preservatives<code> /prɪˈzɜː.və.tɪv/</code> added to keep it from getting stale<code>/steɪl/</code>. These substances<code> /ˈsʌb.stəns/sabusidenseisi</code> may harm our body although they taste good. It’s healthier to have regular meals. However, when I have an appetite<code> /ˈæp·ɪˌtɑɪt/</code> for snacks, I will choose healthier foods, such as peanuts and melon seeds, which contain protein<code>/ˈprəʊ.tiːn/</code> and vitamins<code> /ˈvɪt.ə.mɪn/</code>.</p>

The longer, the better. Besides, I seldom come back to my hometown to have a good square meal with my mother, so on my birthday, I also call her to express my love and miss.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-What-did-you-do-on-your-birthday-when-you-were-young"><a href="#Part-1-What-did-you-do-on-your-birthday-when-you-were-young" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - What did you do on your birthday when you were young?"></a>Part 1 - What did you do on your birthday when you were young?</h3><p>When I was still a child, my birthday always came on weekdays. So I didn’t have much time to do many things. My father would prepare a good square meal for me, which was a pleasant time because I could eat a lot of chicken, and after that, I had to come back to school to finish the afternoon classes. Besides, I always had a good mood because I am grown up.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-think-it-is-important-for-you-to-celebrate-your-birthday"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-think-it-is-important-for-you-to-celebrate-your-birthday" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Do you think it is important for you to celebrate your birthday?"></a>Part 1 - Do you think it is important for you to celebrate your birthday?</h3><p>No, I don’t think so. Because I am already an adult and it’s no need to spare time to celebrate it anymore. However, I think it’s an excellent time to express my love to my mother. Because I know how difficult and complex childbearing and childrearing are. I appreciate what she has done. So it’s meaningful to show how I appreciate her love on my birthday. </p>
<h2 id="Social-Media"><a href="#Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="Social Media"></a>Social Media</h2><h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-or-your-friends-like-using-social-media"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-or-your-friends-like-using-social-media" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Do  you or your friends like using social media?"></a>Part 1 - Do  you or your friends like using social media?</h3><p>Absolutely yes! Social media innovations<code>/ˌɪn.əˈveɪ.ʃən/inneweishenzi</code> have totally revolutionised<code>/ˌrev.əˈluː.ʃən.aɪz/ruiwolushennaizide</code> our lives<code> /laɪvz/ laiwuzi</code> and it is indispensable<code>/ˌɪn.dɪˈspen.sə.bəl/</code> and incredibly<code>/ɪnˈkred.ə.bli/</code> convenient<code>/kənˈviː.ni.ənt/</code> for us nowadays<code>/ˈnaʊ.ə.deɪz/</code>. For instance, we use WeChat, DingTalk, and Weibo to connect and communicate with each other quickly, efficiently<code>/ɪˈfɪʃ.ənt.li/</code> and reliably<code>/rɪˈlaɪ.ə.bli/</code> even across distance. These applications allow us to make free video and voice calls, share interesting contents, play games anytime, anywhere. For these reasons, me and my friends are really into social media.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-think-you-or-your-friends-use-too-much-social-media"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-think-you-or-your-friends-use-too-much-social-media" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Do you think you or your friends use too much social media?"></a>Part 1 - Do you think you or your friends use too much social media?</h3><p>Certainly. We are constantly<code>/ˈkɒn.stənt.li/</code> consuming and completely addicted to the overwhelming<code>/ˌəʊ.vəˈwel.mɪŋ/ouwowailming</code> content on social media. Most of this information doesn’t lead to any worthwhile<code> /ˌwɜːθˈwaɪl/</code> change in our behaviour<code>/bɪˈheɪ.vjər/</code> and our lives<code>/laɪvz/</code>. We tend to put so much attention to it that would alienate<code>/ˈeɪ.li.ə.neɪt/ </code> us from our friends and family. In addition, it will expose us to some bad habits,  and it will shorten attention towards somethings because it’s distracting<code>/dɪˈstræk.tɪŋ/</code>. What’s more, we are so engrossed<code>/ɪnˈɡrəʊst/</code> in the social media that we forget to do some beneficial<code>/ˌben.ɪˈfɪʃ.əl/</code> activities<code> /ækˈtɪv.ə.ti/ aketeiweiteisi</code> such reading and exercising<code> /ˈek.sə.saɪz/aikesesaizing</code>. So, personally, we should maintain a healthy balance between entertainment on the internet and socialising<code>/ˈsəʊ.ʃəl.aɪz/soushoulaizing</code> in real-life situations. </p>

This is because I’m not into social marketing and management. Just a few day ago, I was discussing this topic with one of my friends, who has an internship<code> /ˈɪn.tɜːn.ʃɪp/</code> in a social media. She told me that there were heavy workloads that she had to do overtime. Every day, she writes and makes blogs to gain more followers<code> /ˈfɒl.əʊ.ər/</code> and subscribers<code>/səbˈskraɪ.bər/</code>. Additionally, employees working in social media need to get on the bandwagon<code>/ˈbændˌwæɡ.ən/</code>. They must keep themselves updated<code> /ʌpˈdeɪt/apudeiteide</code> with the last trends so that post relevant<code>/ˈrel.ə.vənt/railewenta</code> or eye-catching<code>/ˈaɪˌkætʃ.ɪŋ/</code> contents. For that reason, I do not want to work in such a demanding environment. </p>
<h3 id="Part-1-What’s-the-most-popular-social-media-in-china-why"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-most-popular-social-media-in-china-why" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - What’s  the most popular social media in china? why?"></a>Part 1 - What’s  the most popular social media in china? why?</h3><p>WeChat is the most prominent<code>/ˈprɒm.ɪ.nənt/puruomonenent</code> social media platform in China. It is a messaging app<code> /æp/</code> that has significant<code> /sɪɡˈnɪf.ɪ.kənt/</code> features such as online payment method, free video calls and chats. Basically, it has combined<code> /kəmˈbaɪnd/</code> social elements similar to Facebook where people can also see other profiles<code> /ˈprəʊ.faɪl/</code> and share information. It allows users to communicate and connect with each other. Apart from that, people can also play mini-games and book tickets using this app. It’s incredibly<code>/ɪnˈkred.ə.bli/</code> convenient<code>/kənˈviː.ni.ənt/</code> and accessible<code> /əkˈses.ə.bəl/</code> as long as we have access<code> /ˈæk.ses/</code> to the internet compared to making phones and texting. Therefore, WeChat has become a part of our daily lives<code>/laɪvz/</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Names"><a href="#Names" class="headerlink" title="Names"></a>Names</h2><h3 id="Part-1-Does-your-name-have-a-special-meaning"><a href="#Part-1-Does-your-name-have-a-special-meaning" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Does your name have a special meaning?"></a>Part 1 - Does your name have a special meaning?</h3><p>Certainly! My name means looking at the star. My mom used to tell me that she likes to watch the starry<code> /ˈstɑː.ri/ sidarui</code> sky. She is a farmer and she is working in the field all day. Besides, she can only rest after doing her daily chores<code>/tʃɔːr/</code>. <strong>After a long day at work</strong>, she usually lays down on the recliner<code>/rɪˈklaɪ.nər/</code> on the balcony<code>/ˈbæl.kə.ni/</code>, watching the stars above her to relieve her feeling.  That’s how my name was created, and she wished that I could forget my exhaustion<code>/ɪɡˈzɔːs.tʃən/</code> when looking at the starry night.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-How-do-you-choose-names-for-your-next-generation"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-you-choose-names-for-your-next-generation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - How do you choose names for your next generation?"></a>Part 1 - How do you choose names for your next generation?</h3><p>To be honest, my family does not really pay attention when choosing names for the next generation. They just create it randomly. As a matter of fact, Chinese characters have corresponding<code>/ˌkɒr.ɪˈspɒn.dɪŋ/</code> meanings, so they focus on names that have positive connotations<code>/ˌkɒn.əˈteɪ.ʃən/</code>. Nevertheless<code>/ˌnev.ə.ðəˈles/neiveleisi</code>, I want my children to be named after the words related to study since I realized that education is significant.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Does-anyone-in-your-family-have-the-same-name-with-you"><a href="#Part-1-Does-anyone-in-your-family-have-the-same-name-with-you" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  Does anyone in your family have the same name with you?"></a>Part 1 -  Does anyone in your family have the same name with you?</h3><p>None at all. Based on my experience, there is a custom practiced by my extended family to not have the same names. Unlike other families, they don’t care whether their children or relatives have the same identity. However, in our case, children are not allowed to own identical names as their relatives, because they consider this as a disrespectful behaviour. I still remember that my uncle changed his son’s name simply because one word in my name was the same as my cousin’s. Personally, this is unreasonable and pedantic. </p>

As far as I can remember, people used to name their children with some characters related to our country which show their <strong>vigorous support</strong> for the nation. <em><strong>*Additionally*</strong></em>, there was also a period of time when people chose some words related to power, lucky, happiness, fortune, smiles, you name it. Nowadays, due to the influence of cyber-culture, young couples create names that are more modern and non-mainstream for their children.</p>

Because on scorching summer days, especially in Chongqing, I want to turn the air conditioning on and stay inside every day. Besides, the sweltering day does me not have much of an appetite. Moreover, eating hotpots in cold weather is blissfully happy.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-prefer-dry-or-wet-weather"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-prefer-dry-or-wet-weather" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Do you prefer dry or wet weather?"></a>Part 1 - Do you prefer dry or wet weather?</h3><p>Neither. I prefer calm weather. Because of the continuous rain every winter in Chongqing,  it’s hard to dry clothes after washing clothes. Besides, dressings in the cloakroom are also a bit damp. Moreover, the muggy weather here is also uncomfortable. So I like mild weather.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-What-is-the-weather-like-in-your-hometown"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-weather-like-in-your-hometown" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - What is the weather like in your hometown?"></a>Part 1 - What is the weather like in your hometown?</h3><p>My hometown lies in the centre of China, where summer is hot and winter is cold. When I was young, there used to be a blanket of snow lying on the ground after driving snow. In addition, the river used to cover a thick sheet of ice. However, my hometown hasn’t had many heavy snow flurries these years because of global warming. The river doesn’t get iced over anymore.</p>

Why?"></a>Part 1 - Do you like singing? Why?</h3><p>Actually, I am not fond of singing, and I always keep a low profile when it comes to singing. Probably, because I was never expose to music. In addition, I’m completely tone-deaf and I sing off-key(out of tune). I could still remember when I was in grade 6, my music teacher asked me to sing in front of the class. However, I told her that I didn’t have a good voice. As a result, she punished me and made me stand in my desk the entire class. I felt so embarrassed<code> /ɪmˈbær.əst/</code> that I developed an anxiety<code> /æŋˈzaɪ.ə.ti/</code> to sing. That’s why, I don’t like singing and eschew<code> /ɪsˈtʃuː/</code> it whenever possible. </p>

It’s ironic<code> /aɪˈrɒn.ɪk/airuoneike</code> to say yes to this question because as  what I’ve said, I’m not into singing. Yet, when I was in college, I had a crush<code>/krʌʃ/</code> on a young singer in our campus<code> /ˈkæm.pəs/</code>, who inspired me to learn singing. I did not have a formal voice lessons, but I tried to practice it by watching videos online. However, the feeling was not mutual<code> /ˈmjuː.tʃu.əl/miuchuou</code>. She told me that I wasn’t her type. The unrequited<code>/ˌʌn.rɪˈkwaɪ.tɪd/unruikuaiteide</code> love wrecked<code> /rekt/</code> me emotionally, so I gave it up.   </p>

She was my ideal girlfriend because she has all the qualities<code>/ˈkwɒl.ə.ti/kuoleiteisi</code> a man would look for. However, I didn’t have the courage<code> /ˈkʌr.ɪdʒ/</code> to sing in front of her, because of the fact that I don’t have that kind of talent.  But, if I have a sweet-sounding<code>/swiːt/``/saʊnd/</code> voice, I would have sung<code>sangge</code> for that girl to express my feelings.  </p>

Although I don’t like to sing, it’s quite evident<code> /ˈev.ɪ.dənt/</code> that it brings joy to some people, most especially to those who have this kind of talent. For instance, people who are undergoing a lot of stress would probably go out and spend time singing in a Karaoke<code> /ˌkær.iˈəʊ.ki/karuioukei</code> bar with  their peers to give vent<code>/vent/</code> out their frustrations<code>/frʌsˈtreɪ.ʃən/furuasizhuishen</code>. Furthermore, if they can relate<code> /rɪˈleɪt/</code> to the lyrics<code>/ˈlɪr.ɪk/leiruike</code> of the song, they would feel more relax and at ease. Moreover, I really like a singer named Zhou Shen. His songs always  inspires and relieves me.   </p>

My girlfriend likes to stroll in a local supermarket close to our university, so we sometimes ride bikes there. In addition, we sometimes take underground to visit my uncle. However, my girlfriend doesn’t like to take the tube because there are crowded. Besides, I also choose ride-hailing if there is a discount. </p>

Because there is no public transport in my village and I could meet all my needs in my town when I was a child. However, when I went to high school, I began to take the bus. Every three weeks, I took a shuttle from my home to school. The journey was a nightmare because the bus was always overloaded, and I had to stand up for almost two hours. </p>

Because public transportation, such as the subway and bus, is inconvenient and crowded. In addition, these vehicles don’t provide door-to-door service, so they have to walk or transfer to their destination. However, sometimes they have to take public transport because it’s cheaper. Besides, they may encounter traffic jams in rush hour if they drive personal cars.</p>

I think geography is quite interesting and essential, especially physical geography. Things like natural environment and the planet are significant. In addition, I am concerned about climate change, ecosystems and environmental problems happening in our global. Therefore, I develop a liking for geography.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Have-you-ever-studied-geography-at-school"><a href="#Part-1-Have-you-ever-studied-geography-at-school" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  Have you ever studied geography at school?"></a>Part 1 -  Have you ever studied geography at school?</h3><p>Absolutely. Geography is one of the national curriculums in our country. I still remember that my teachers taught us that how to calculate a surface area by measuring degrees and lengths, how to understand topics like ocean circulation, acid rains. Some of mathematical formulates are very difficult and abstract, so I didn’t get a good score in geography. </p>

I remembered that our teacher had taught us how to read a map, but I seldom was expose to a situation that I need to read a map to locate my course and find out the route. In addition, I don’t have a printed map of any city of China. Moreover, the revolutionized technology on smartphones makes us locate and guide incredibly convenient. Therefore, I am terrible at map reading.</p>
<p>But rarely did I have occasion to use it.</p>

I want to visit Coromandel, a island of New Zealand because I have yearning of beach. Actually, I never have had the chance to watch sea since I have been living in the inland of China. I am impressed and attached to the coast in Coromandel. There are spectacular costal walkway, hot water beach, and other attractions. The most scenic site I want to experience is a cove where I can take a boat and a local guide will explain the geology and culture for me. </p>

I did many puzzles<code>/ˈpʌz.əl/</code> when I was a child such as Crossword, Jigsaw<code>/ˈdʒɪɡ.sɔː/</code>, Chinese riddle<code>/ˈrɪd.əl/</code>, Magic square, and Sudoku<code>/suˈdəʊ.kuː/</code>.  Among them, I was crazy about Sudoku. It is a number game where we need to fill all the empty<code> /ˈemp.ti/</code> squares with numbers according to the hints<code>/hɪnt/</code> that you can see in every line since there are already digits<code>/ˈdɪdʒ.ɪt/</code> that will be set out on the grids. All I need to do is to make sure that I are not repeating the same numbers ranging from 1-9 in each row and column<code>/ˈkɒl.əm/</code>. Although, it is difficult and time-consuming, I still enjoyed it because it was mind-challenging<code>/ˈtʃæl.ɪn.dʒɪŋ/</code> and thrilling<code> /ˈθrɪl.ɪŋ/siruiling</code>. I always get the experience of fulfilment<code> /fʊlˈfɪl.mənt/</code> once I solve the puzzle immediately<code>/ɪˈmiː.di.ət.li/</code>.   </p>

To be honest, I only play puzzles when I have the pleasure to do so since I am no longer interested in them. For instance, when I read newspapers and magazines I  sometimes run into Sudoku and that’s the only time I try to solve<code> /sɒlv/sevu</code> it. In addition, there are more entertaining<code> /en.təˈteɪ.nɪŋ/enteteining</code> games that can be found on the internet such as the mini-games in WeChat, where I can play and share with my social media friends conveniently<code> /kənˈviː.ni.ənt.li/kenvinientalei</code>. Therefore, I seldom take part in mind-altering games such as puzzles because of the overwhelming<code> /ˌəʊ.vəˈwel.mɪŋ/ouwowelming</code> content of online platforms.   </p>

I can still remember when our teacher used to ask the class riddles as an ice breaker. Once we guess it correctly<code> /kəˈrekt.li/</code>, we will receive a prize. Since, I am not good at word games, it was hard for me to win a reward. Solving riddles is as hard as managing conflicts since I need to think critically and train my thought to come up with the right answer. On the other hand, number puzzles are easier since there is no need for us to examine a problem, all we have to do is to list down possible answers directly to get an accurate result.   </p>

Puzzles can help prevent old people from acquiring serious<code> /ˈsɪə.ri.əs/</code> brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s<code>ˈ/ɔltsˌhɑɪ·mərz/oucihaimozi</code>  which often happens because of their age. When playing these games, they not only exercise their brain and improve their memory but also, maintain their ability to handle complex tasks and strengthen<code>/ˈstreŋ.θən/sizhunsen</code> their reasoning<code>/ˈriː.zən.ɪŋ/ruizenning</code> skills.  In addition, together with aerobic<code> /eəˈrəʊ.bɪk/airoubeike</code> exercise, the elderly can build up stronger mental and physical health since it releases<code> /rɪˈliːs/ruiliseisi</code> the tension<code>/ˈten.ʃən/ </code> they feel in their brain when they are under stress.</p>

I actually study intensely every week. At the beginning of the week, I make to-do lists. In addition, I need to read essays and take notes every day. What’s more, I also write assignments because they’re part of the criteria of my study. Besides, sometimes I add captions to my WeChat moments after running.</p>

<p> I’d like to talk about one of my classmates in college who likes to dress fashionably<code> /ˈfæʃ.ən.ə.bli/fashenebolei</code>.  She is well-known as, Yingying.  She is pretty tall and absolutely gorgeous.  She has a long, jet-black hair. She actually bears a striking<code>/ˈstraɪ.kɪŋ/</code> resemblance<code> /rɪˈzem.bləns/</code> of a famous Chinese singer. She probably needs to maintain all of these qualities because she is a vlogger. She earns a little extra  money by sharing her videos about beautiful dresses and she posts them on her social media accounts. Then, she will buy new clothes again and advertise<code> /ˈæd.və.taɪz/</code> them online.  </p>
<p>She is crazy about the Chinese traditional culture<code> /ˈkʌl.tʃər/kouqie</code> and is a big fan of ancient Chinese outfit such as Hanfu and Qipao. Hanfu is the oldest form of clothing in China, adopted and vigorously<code> /ˈvɪɡ.ər.əs.li/weigeresilei</code> promoted by the ruling class of Han dynasty<code>/ˈdɪn.ə.sti/</code>.  On the other hand, Qipao, also named as cheongsam<code> /ˌtʃɒŋˈsæm/changsamu</code>,  is the most famous traditional clothing that originated<code> /əˈrɪdʒ.ən.eɪt/ouruijinneiteide</code> in Shanghai in the 1920s. It quickly became a fashion phenomenon<code> /fəˈnɒm.ɪ.nən/feinomeinen</code> that was adopted by movie stars and schoolgirls alike<code>/əˈlaɪk/</code>.     </p>
<p>Based on her videos, I would say that she really appreciates<code> /əˈpriː.ʃi.eɪt/epuruisheieici</code> Chinese culture. That’s why, she’s into traditional style<code> /staɪl/</code>. Unlike the younger generation<code> /ˌdʒen.əˈreɪ.ʃən/jinneruishen</code> of today’s society,  she prefers to wear these attire<code> /əˈtaɪər/</code> to promote<code> /prəˈməʊt/</code> cultural relativism<code>/ˈrel.ə.tɪ.vɪ.zəm/rueileiteiweizemu</code>.  She wants to spread it, so that the whole world can recognise its significance<code> /sɪɡˈnɪf.ɪ.kəns/seigeneifukensi</code> to our history by making vlogs<code>/vlɒɡ/</code>.  She thinks the Hanfu and Qipao are spectacular and pleasant to wear.  She always shares videos about the amazing Chinese ancient dress-up with beautiful hairstyles on the internet.  In addition, she said that wearing these clothes would bring her more confidence and can help her establish<code> /ɪˈstæb.lɪʃ/</code> good connection with other fashion-loving people.  Therefore, I consider her as a huge fan of fashion industry, especially Chinese ancient clothing.  </p>

Why?"></a>Part 3 - Do you think online shopping will replace in-store shopping in the future? Why?</h4><p> I doubt that in-store shopping will be replaced by online shopping. Shopping online nowadays is incredibly<code> /ɪnˈkred.ə.bli/incerueidebelei</code> convenient, more efficient and faster than before because of the advancement in delivery<code> /dɪˈlɪv.ər.i/diliwurui</code> and websites.  Moreover, people don’t need to leave their house since they can just get what  they want from various<code>/ˈveə.ri.əs/</code> applications on their smartphones and stuffs will be  transported within a few days. If they are not satisfied with the products, they can return them and get a refund<code> /ˈriː.fʌnd/</code> right away. On the other hand, some people like strolling at the mall<code> /mɔːl/</code>, street markets and so on. They tend to test the products personally<code>/ˈpɜː.sən.əl.i/</code> to ensure their quality<code>/ˈkwɒl.ə.ti/</code>. In addition, with the help of a friendly and knowledgeable sales associate<code> /əˈsəʊ.ʃi.ət/esoushierta</code> and an up-close look at the goods, consumers would have a more excellent personal shopping experience in the brick-and-mortar<code> /ˌbrɪk.ənˈmɔː.tər/</code> retailer<code>/ˈriː.teɪ.lər/</code>. So,  it depends on the preferences<code>/ˈpref.ər.əns/purueiferunsi</code> of the people.  </p>

They believed that it speaks about their personality and attitude. For example, a person would consider wearing a professional<code> /prəˈfeʃ.ən.əl/</code> attire<code> /əˈtaɪər/</code> when attending a job interview to form a good impression. This will also boost their self-confidence and self-esteem<code> /ˌself.ɪˈstiːm/</code> because they are pleasant to look at. The way they dress allows potential employers to consider their application because of how they present themselves professionally<code> /prəˈfeʃ.ən.əl.i/</code>. Another thing, people just want to hear positive  comments from others because of their looks. Therefore, I can say that we have different views when it comes to fashion, depending on its necessity<code> /nəˈses.ə.ti/</code> in our situation.   </p>

They have less chance to keep up with the fashion trend because they may not understand how to use the new gadgets<code> /ˈɡædʒ.ɪt/</code>. Youngsters<code> /ˈjʌŋ.stər/yangsita</code> are more skilful and adaptable<code>/əˈdæp.tə.bəl/edaputebou</code> to change. They can easily learn how to operate smartphones and search information on the internet.

Why?"></a>Part 3 - Are women more fashionable than men? Why?</h4><p>Answer  structure: Response + Reason + Example + Conclusion</p>
<p> Totally! Women are particular when it comes to the clothes they wear compared to men. This is because they are more likely pressured to keep up with their friends or acquaintances’<code>/əˈkweɪn.təns/akuoentenseisi</code> trendy<code> /ˈtren.di/</code> outfits. On the other hand, we don’t spend too much effort on choosing which clothes to wear. As long as it is comfortable and neat then it would be enough. For instance, women would take a lot of time to dress-up and would complain if they are wearing the same style. Although it is not necessary, yet they would argue to be different from others specially when they are attending important events. In addition, they perceive<code> /pəˈsiːv/</code> fashion as a competition<code> /ˌkɒm.pəˈtɪʃ.ən/kangmupoteishen</code> against other women. That’s why, women are more fashion-minded and pay more attention on how they look.   </p>

<p>Actually, everyone I know in my hometown could grow plants well; however, when it comes to a person who is really into growing plants, it must be my grandmother. </p>
<p>My grandmother is a traditional Chinese farmer. She was born in about 1947 and didn’t know her actual birthday because her parents had many children then and couldn’t remember. She is extremely considerate, sensitive and approachable. </p>
<p>She has a small yard in front of her house, where she always grows plants. She really has green fingers and is fond of growing plants. She plants vegetables according to seasons. In Spring, she often grows warm-season vegetables such as cucumbers, Chinese eggplants, tomatoes, bitter melon, potatoes and so on. When autumn comes, she plants some cold-season crops, like white radish, Chinese cabbage, spring onion, garlic, you name it. Sometimes, she grows some flowers that I don’t know their names, but my grandmother often uses them to paint her fingernails.<br>What’s more, she once planted a cherry tree. I still remember when I was about six years old, I would become an avid eater of cherries in July. That was an absolute happy time. Every time the cherries turned red and were ripe, I tried to climb the tree but failed since I was too short at that time to get the branch. Then my grandfather would lift me to pick them up. However, it was removed when I could climb that tree because my grandparents needed to reconstruct their house.</p>
<p>At my grandmother’s early age, growing was a skill that every farmer must master. They grow crops and plants for life. It gradually turns into her lifelong habit. She is fond of growing since she likes the sense of self-sufficiency. </p>

<p>I have two neighbours in my hometown and Miss. Peng is undoubtedly an interesting person.</p>
<p>She is pretty tall and absolutely gorgeous. She has long, sleek, and jet-black hair. What important is that her fingers are long, delicate, and smooth, which is why she is good at playing a traditional Chinese instrument-guzheng- in other words, the Chinese zither.</p>
<p>I first knew her about, let me see, twelve years ago, when she came back home for vacation. She had been learning music at the Central Conservatory of Music for five years, and even on holiday, she chose to stay at university to practice guzheng.</p>
<p>She would play guzheng every morning, and I woke up to the lovely sound. What was extremely interesting was that one day, I saw her dressed beautifully in her hanfu, recreating current, popular, western music on guzheng. I just couldn’t envision that <strong>see you again</strong> could be performed like that. A very distinctive tone, many glides, fingerings, and vibrato of guzheng were used to express emotions. They are very well integrated. That was awesome and rocking, and she must be super familiar with that song. The ability to transform a Western song to play on the guzheng really gave me pleasure and held my attention. </p>

<p>I follow many people on social media and want to share a person I followed on YouTube. She is Jingxuan Peng, a master’s degree candidate in France. Her nickname on social media is Peng Peng. </p>
<p>(She is pretty tall and absolutely gorgeous. She has long, sleek, and jet-black hair. It is worth mentioning that her fingers are long, delicate, and smooth.)</p>
<p>I first knew her when I was watching short videos on YouTube recently. A video uploaded by her caught my eye. In this video, she dressed in gorgeous Chinese clothing and performed a western song on the traditional Chinese instrument-guzheng-, in other words, a Chinese zither. When I saw this video, I couldn’t envision that “See you again” could be performed that way. A distinctive tone, many glides, fingerings, and vibrato of guzheng were used to express emotions and are very well integrated.

<p>She posts her life abroad in French. She also shares videos about she played guzheng with different tempo songs. In addition, she adapted some foreign pop songs to play them with guzheng.</p>

<p><strong>Order of adjectives - a  classical blue Chinese brick rural house</strong>     </p>
<p><strong>Determiner, opinion, size,  physical quality, shape, age, colour, origin, material, type, purpose, noun</strong>    </p>
<p>Actually, I have been staying in Chongqing for about two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic and have never left the city. But I’d like to talk about my grandparents’ home where I usually went every week before when I was young yet, now I only visit it during important events.  </p>
<p>My grandparents live in the countryside of central China. Their house is a classical blue Chinese brick rural house, designed by themselves. The main body was built with bricks and the roof was constructed with tiles. The roof is intersecting, and we commonly call it as - “Ren”- in  Chinese which means people. They also have a small yard in the front, a red-cemented<code> /sɪˈment/sementeide</code> kitchen, and a spot for watchdog.      </p>
<p>My grandmother is really into growing plants in the yard. She plants cold and warm-season vegetables according to the quarter<code> /ˈkwɔː.tər/kuote</code>, such as Chinese cabbage, potatoes, cucumbers<code>/ˈkjuː.kʌm.bər/ </code>, Chinese eggplants, white radishes, tomatoes, bitter melons, you name it. In addition, there used to be a cherry tree and a small rabbit farm. We harvested<code> /ˈhɑː.vɪst/haweisiteide</code> ripe<code> /raɪp/</code> cherries in July and I eventually became an avid<code>/ˈæv.ɪd/</code> eater of cherries. Moreover, they made extra money by selling rabbits’ hair. However, when I grew up, the cherry tree and rabbit house were removed for some reason.  Those were absolutely the happiest time of my life.       </p>
<p>Actually, their house is extremely ordinary and conservative.  Also, there is no WiFi<code> /ˈwaɪ.faɪ/</code>, so it is really inconvenient<code>/ˌɪn.kənˈviː.ni.ənt/yinkenviniente</code> to use smartphones because of the terrible phone service<code>/ˈsɜː.vɪs/</code>. But their home is more like a haven<code> /ˈheɪ.vən/</code> from the hustle and bustle of the city life and it is satisfying<code>/ˈsæt.ɪs.faɪ.ɪŋ/</code> to spend time with my grandparents.      </p>
<p>Every time, I come back to that tranquil<code> /ˈtræŋ.kwɪl/</code> place, my grandmother will make dumplings for me and my grandfather will buy my favourite fruits, which increases my well-being.  </p>

<p>Actually, I have been staying at our university because of COVID-19 pandemic. I want to talk about our playground which is also a popular site for students to do physical activities.</p>
<p>I went there just a few days ago and I go running there about twice a week. It is a wonderful spot set in the north of my campus. It is quite a broad area with six basketball courts, four tennis courts and two football courts. Circled with football courts is the racetrack. There is also a lake nearby with beautiful flowers, swans and koi that are various colours.</p>
<p>Last time I went there and went high-intensity interval training, short for HIIT.  HIIT is a kind of physical training consisting of short periods of intense exercise with short periods of rest in a single interval.  I usually do four intervals, and each interval is made up of fast running and jogging. It’s very energetic, exhausted, particularly in the last terms. However, every time I finish that, I find self-fulfilment. I don’t have many close friends to company me to do other exercises and everyday study life is excessively repeated and tedious. Only when I put on my earphones and run in the night, I find the new meaning of life. </p>
<p>Like other students who also like this haven, we exercise to find meaning, give our pressure and stress out, or enjoy leisure from the hustle and bustle of daily life. </p>

<p>I want to share an awful<code>/ˈɔː.fəl/</code> experience when I bought some memory cards online about ten years ago. </p>
<p>One day in high school, while surfing Taobao, I found some memory cards were selling at a very low discount. I could not imagine that I could own a 128GB<code> /ˈɡɪɡ.ə.baɪt/geigebaite</code> card just for 40 Chinese Yuan. In an excited mood, I ordered two cards. This package was delivered from Guangdong province and was incredibly faster than usual. After I received them, I showed off to my friends. As a result, my friends also wanted to have one. However, the seller closed the URL. And I didn’t realise that he had fooled me. Instead, I thought it was a real bargain.</p>
<p>However, when I tried to save more videos, my computer told me that my drive was corrupted and must be formatted before it could be used again. What’s worse, the previous data was lost. At that time, I knew I had bought a fake. Unscrupulous<code>/ʌnˈskruː.pjə.ləs/ansikurupiulesi</code> manufacturers intentionally modified the memory cards to report the unreal capacity<code> /kəˈpæs.ə.ti/kepasetei</code>. Sadly, I found the store had been closed, and I couldn’t get my money back.</p>
<p>I felt angry with these fraudsters<code>/ˈfrɔːd.stər/</code> because they hurt my trust. In addition, I thought I was silly. I should have checked this store repeatedly because it’s very much a “buyer beware” when buying things at an unrealistic<code> /ˌʌn.rɪəˈlɪs.tɪk/</code> price.</p>

<p>  Actually, I have been  staying indoors at my university because of the COVID-19 pandemic<code>/pænˈdem.ɪk/</code>. The last  time I went out was on Labour Day<code> /ˈleɪ.bə ˌdeɪ/</code>, specifically<code> /spəˈsɪf.ɪ.kəl.i/</code> on May 1st. My  friend,  who was also my roommate, invited me to go fishing and one of our classmates, who has not fished before, also came with us.</p>
<p>It was a day of clear skies and  unbroken sunshine with light wind. After eating breakfast, we rode a share-bike together and went to a nearby lake in our college<code>/ˈkɒl.ɪdʒ/</code>. We also took  with us our fishing tackles<code> /ˈtæk·əl/</code>. My classmate was bubbling<code> /ˈbʌb.əl/</code> with excitement because it was his first time to go fishing.</p>
<p>When we got there, we chose a tranquil<code> /ˈtræŋ.kwɪl/</code> spot. We adjusted our fishing rods<code> /rɒd</code> and started to catch fishes. In beginning, me and my friend were so engrossed<code> /ɪnˈɡrəʊst/</code> during the activity that we forgot to help our classmate. As a result, he was disappointed<code>/ˌdɪs.əˈpɔɪn.tɪd/</code> and upset, then he called my attention to ask for help. So, I stopped what I was doing and instructed him about the essential <strong>processes<code> /ˈprəʊ.ses/purouseseisi</code></strong>- the state of the fish, how it swallows<code> /ˈswɒl.əʊ/siwolousi</code> the food in the hook<code>/hʊk/</code>, and the correct position of the <strong>rod</strong>. After an hour,  he eventually picked up the procedures<code>/prəˈsiː.dʒər/posijesi</code> I taught him. When he got his first fish, he was blissfully<code> /ˈblɪs.fəl.i/buleisifelei</code> happy. At the end of the day, we got about 20 fishes.</p>
<p>It was a rewarding and fulfilling day because we were able to free ourselves from the hustle and bustle of studying. In addition, it was also a wonderful bonding<code> /ˈbɒn.dɪŋ/</code> opportunity for us. It was great to spend leisure<code>/ˈleʒ.ər/</code> time with friends. I loved kicking<code> /kɪk/keiking</code> back and at the same time <strong>experiencing</strong> the cool breeze and sunshine.   </p>
<h4 id="Part-3-What-outdoor-activities-are-popular-in-China"><a href="#Part-3-What-outdoor-activities-are-popular-in-China" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 - What outdoor activities are popular in China?"></a>Part 3 - What outdoor activities are popular in China?</h4><p>  There are a great number of popular outdoor activities in China such as having a nighttime stroll<code>/strəʊl/</code> along the road, running, dancing in the park, rafting<code>/ˈrɑːf.tɪŋ/</code> and so on. For instance, elderly usually likes to dance in the park. It is a healthy way for them to relax because it is a form of exercise. It can help stretch<code> /stretʃ/</code> their muscles when they dance along with the music. Moreover, some people choose to stroll at night along the road after dinner, which is also an easy way to help digestion<code> /daɪˈdʒes.tʃən/</code>. Besides when the evening falls, the whole city becomes a sea of lights. Walking while seeing this pleasant<code> /ˈplez.ənt/</code> scenery<code> /ˈsiː.nər.i/sinerui</code> at night relieves us from the stress and pressure.  Therefore, outside exercises not only improve our physical aspect<code>/ˈæs.pekt/asibaiketa</code> but also our mental health.   </p>
<h4 id="Part-3-Are-those-people-who-like-dangerous-activities-more-likely-to-be-successful"><a href="#Part-3-Are-those-people-who-like-dangerous-activities-more-likely-to-be-successful" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 - Are those people who like dangerous activities more likely to be successful?"></a>Part 3 - Are those people who like dangerous activities more likely to be successful?</h4><p>I’m not sure. Those who like daring and dangerous activities tend to be adventurous<code>/ədˈven.tʃər.əs/edewenqieresi</code> and self-assured<code> /əˈʃɔːd/</code>. Also, they have the nerve<code> /nɜːv/</code> to challenge themselves so, these characteristics<code> /ˌkær.ək.təˈrɪs.tɪk/</code> may probably be a recipe<code> /ˈres.ɪ.pi/</code> for <strong>success</strong>. For example, if a person loves to do extremely<code> /ɪkˈstriːm.li/</code> perilous<code>/ˈper.əl.əs/</code>(dangerous)  sports such as paragliding<code>/ˈpær.əˌɡlaɪ.dɪŋ/</code>, edge walking and car racing without any hesitations<code>/ˌhez.ɪˈteɪ.ʃən/</code>,  would risk finding a solution how to deal and handle the situation and to win the game. However, the people who prefers a normal and safe ventures are less likely to develop a sense of control, since they depend on the idea that they can just follow those who are in charge. What I mean is, they would rather do easy tasks than challenging themselves to become competitive individuals.  Personally, they can all be successful, as long as they keep on trying.   </p>
<h4 id="Part-3-Do-you-think-it’s-better-for-people-to-change-jobs-when-there-are-new-chances"><a href="#Part-3-Do-you-think-it’s-better-for-people-to-change-jobs-when-there-are-new-chances" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 - Do you think it’s better for people to change jobs when there are new chances?"></a>Part 3 - Do you think it’s better for people to change jobs when there are new chances?</h4><p>It depends. People who earn a living can change their jobs when there are better opportunities, especially when they are offered competitive<code> /kəmˈpet.ɪ.tɪv/</code> salaries. This allows them to provide adequate<code>/ˈæd.ə.kwət/</code> needs for their family. In addition, those employees<code> /ɪmˈplɔɪ.iː/</code> who faces heavy workload on a daily basis would definitely<code>/ˈdef.ɪ.nət.li/</code> need to look for a new employer, who doesn’t require them to do demanding jobs. On the other hand, if the new working environment pressures<code>/ˈpreʃ.ər/</code> workers to do an overtime and menial<code> /ˈmiː.ni.əl/</code>, it would be best to keep the current role. Yet, you still need to consider your career growth and personal development. Therefore, it’s wise to list all pros and cons and weigh the possible outcomes.</p>
<h4 id="Part-3-Should-young-people-try-as-many-new-activities-as-possible"><a href="#Part-3-Should-young-people-try-as-many-new-activities-as-possible" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 - Should young people try as many new activities as possible?"></a>Part 3 - Should young people try as many new activities as possible?</h4><p> <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/variety-is-the-spice-of-life">variety is the spice of life</a></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! However, young people should find a more reasonable and suitable ventures as much as possible. Some activities need specialised and critical instructions otherwise they can be dangerous, such as edge walking and cliff camping. Another thing is, their abilities have limitations therefore, it would be impossible for them to learn all undertakings that they come across with. It is best to concentrate on one activity at a time. However,  the child’s attention’s span is far different from an adult. There’s a  possibility that their focus will shift from one activity to another so, it would be helpful to train these individuals to stay centred on one subject before proceeding to another one. To sum it all up, we should just let them choose activities that they really like.   </p>

<p>I still remembered the disagreement that I had with my younger sister two years ago.</p>
<p>It was summer before I went to my university. To celebrate the qualification that I got to pursue my master’s degree, my father decided to catch a fish in the nearby river and made a good square meal for me. </p>
<p>He got up very early that day and ate instant food. Then, he rode on his bike to go fishing. He finally came back in the afternoon with a 5-kilogram carp. My sister and I stared at the fish, bubbling with excitement. My father asked us how he should cook it for dinner. I preferred to grill it, but my sister wanted to eat a fish hotpot. The weather was scorching hot, so I thought that eating hotpot in our small dining hall would make us pour with sweat and uncomfortable, even though we had an air conditioner. Nonetheless, there’s no accounting for taste, my sister still insisted to serve it that way on a sweltering day. Trying to convince my younger sister that we should eat grilled fish was useless, so I flew into rage and asked my dad to cut the fish into two to make two dishes at the same time, one for grilled fish and another for fish hotpot. Finally, my dad said that it would be <em><strong>*inappropriate*</strong></em> to have a hotpot, so we had a barbeque that day. </p>
<p>Although I won the disagreement, I felt I was childish when I was <em><strong>*lying*</strong></em> on my bed. It was not necessary to argue with an eleven-year-old child. I should have <em><strong>*compromised*</strong></em> because I am the adult and the big brother. </p>

One day, one of my close friends told me that if I did that again, she would give up our relationship, too. From then on, I started to transforming my temper. So if I had a disagreement with someone, especially my friends, I would have calmed down firstly. Then I would try to analysis and see their points. Moreover, I would explain their points to them, which is a effective way to express that I had understand their viewpoints. Lastly, I would wholeheartedly reason with them.</p>

Firstly, we must stop criticising and accusing others, which always happens when facing disputes. Then, we should listen carefully to what others say and analyse their feelings and needs. Meanwhile, we need to express to them to check whether we understand their needs. If not, we need to reanalysis. Lastly, we need to find out what we feel and what we need others to do or not to do, then express these to the other side. In both principle and practice, these procedures are always possible and practical. </p>
<p>I would recommend this book to those who want to reach an agreement or compromise with others in a reasonable and friendly means. </p>

It’s necessary that parents should talk with children about respecting others, especially their teachers, before they go to school because children spend the most time with their parents. They usually, directly and indirectly, learn from their parents. If parents teach them or set good examples, they can cultivate the sense and habit of respecting their teachers.  On the other hand, it’s essential that people learn, from a young age, about respecting teachers. So primary schools also can make effort to help children develop habit of respecting teachers.</p>

They may have a disagreement when parents see their children, especially girls, wearing revealing clothes. In addition, some parents don’t like their children listening music or playing smartphones when study. Moreover, they think young generations don’t have a healthy lifestyle and lack some qualities. Youngsters like to stay up and get up late, eat junk foods. Some young people often give up when facing obstructs because they lack of persistence.</p>

<p>I would like to talk about a constructive<code>/kənˈstrʌk.tɪv/</code> suggestion that my tutor<code>/ˈtʃuː.tər/</code> gave me when I was about to give up on my experiments<code> /ɪkˈsper.ɪ.mənt/</code>.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I was doing some experiments<code> /ɪkˈsper.ɪ.mənt/</code> to design an artificial intelligence program. However, the results were not ideal to publish online. I tried harder to do it multiple<code> /ˈmʌl.tɪ.pəl/ mouteipou</code> times, but the outputs was still not the one I had expected<code> /ɪkˈspek.tɪd/</code>. I dwelt<code>/dwel/duwailt</code> on the failure<code> /ˈfeɪ.ljər/</code> I had made and was about to quit.</p>
<p>My tutor noticed my struggles and decided to talk to me to find out my dilemma<code>/daɪˈlem.ə/</code>. He said a heap of words and the most impressive statement he told me was that I was one of his diligent<code>/ˈdɪl.ɪ.dʒənt/</code> and highly motivated<code> /ˈməʊ.tɪ.veɪ.tɪd/</code> students. Moreover, he said that if I would try harder, I could make progress.</p>
<p>After we talked about the problems that I was experiencing<code> /ɪkˈspɪə.ri.əns/</code>, his words made me realised<code>/ˈrɪəlaɪzd/</code> to do my best. He boosted<code> /buːst/busiteide</code> my confidence, so I reexamined<code>/ˌriː.ɪɡˈzæm.ɪn/ruieigezamin</code> my program and revised<code> /rɪˈvaɪz/</code> the core<code>/kɔːr/</code> code. I listed all the things that I had missed, so that I would be aware of them next time. I would never forget how he cheered me up when I was down. His words were inspiring which helped me to complete my tasks with more self-reliance<code>/rɪˈlaɪ.əns/</code>. I couldn’t have published my paper last July without his motivation<code>/ˌməʊ.tɪˈveɪ.ʃən/</code> at that time.</p>

<p>Answer structure: Reason + General Opinion + Personal Opinion +  Future  </p>
<p>There are many reasons behind this. Firstly, lack of sleep or poor routine<code> /ruːˈtiːn/</code> may be one of the causes<code>/kɔːz/kezeizi</code> why children are distracted<code> /dɪˈstræk.tɪd/</code>. Secondly, excessive<code> /ɪkˈses·ɪv/</code> screen<code> /skriːn/</code> time also affects<code>/əˈfekt/</code> their concentration<code>/ˌkɒn.sənˈtreɪ.ʃən/kangsenchuisen</code> since they are easily enthralled<code> /ɪnˈθrɔːl/insiroude</code> with the videos and images that they can see on the Internet. Lastly, if their diet is high in sugar and fat, it harms not only their health but also their ability to concentrate<code> /ˈkɒn.sən.treɪt/kangsenchuita</code>. They need to consume nutritious<code>/njuːˈtrɪʃ.əs/</code> foods to improve their mental capability<code> /ˌkeɪ.pəˈbɪl.ə.ti/</code>. Therefore, children should be taught a healthy lifestyle and eating habits to stay focused.</p>

<p>Answer structure: Opinion + Reason + Example+ Conclusion  </p>
<p>Absolutely! The constant<code>/ˈkɒn.stənt/kangsidenta</code> use of technology will shorten children’s attention span. Being excessively<code> /ekˈses.ɪv.li/aikesesiwulei</code> exposed to contents<code> /kənˈtent/</code> on smartphones, iPads, tablets like short videos, upbeat music and games, harms their concentration<code>/ˌkɒn.sənˈtreɪ.ʃən/kangsenchuisen</code>. Although children are forced to shut down their phones when studying, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/the-gist?q=gist">the gist<code>/dʒɪst/</code></a> of what they saw on the Internet will remain in their minds.

<p>All kinds of jobs need to have an optimal<code> /ˈɒp.tɪ.məl/</code> level of concentration<code>/ˌkɒn.sənˈtreɪ.ʃən/kangsenchuisen</code>. I’d like to talk about my future job as an example.

<p>Answer structure: Opinion + Reason + Example + conclusion</p>
<p>I agree that physical activity can improve one’s concentration<code>/ˌkɒn.sənˈtreɪ.ʃən/kangsenchuisen</code> however we should also have a healthy eating habit at the same time. This is because when we do regular<code> /ˈreɡ.jə.lər/re:giule</code> exercises, it alleviates<code> /əˈliː.vi.eɪt/</code> distractions and keeps us focus on one task. To be honest, running is one of my routine<code> /ruːˈtiːn/</code>. It helps me relieve<code> /rɪˈliːv/</code> all the pressure<code>/ˈpreʃ.ər/ </code> and stress that affects my mental health. As a result, it allows me to divert<code> /daɪˈvɜːt/</code> my attention from thinking negatively to a positive outlook in my study. Therefore, having a balance diet, healthy lifestyle together with professional<code>/prəˈfeʃ.ən.əl/</code> training may improve people’s ability to focus.</p>

For example, one obvious difference is that the most buildings in the city are higher than those in countryside. People come from different  place, even different nations, live in the same buildings. In contrast, houses in countryside tend to be below 3 stories and most time a family live in together. What’s more, most communities in the city, especially in the same building, are totally same, with bedrooms, kitchen, living room, toilet, and a balcony. However, houses in countryside tend to have different style, with a yard, a garden, a tree, a pet house or a livestock house. People live in the same neighbourhood may have different house style.</p>
<h4 id="Part-3-Do-you-prefer-to-live-in-the-city-or-in-the-countryside"><a href="#Part-3-Do-you-prefer-to-live-in-the-city-or-in-the-countryside" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 - Do you prefer to live in the city or in the countryside?"></a>Part 3 - Do you prefer to live in the city or in the countryside?</h4><p>Currently, I would rather living in the city, more specifically, in a modern house with intelligent system. Because there are more opportunities for education and occupation, more-perfect medical facilities, and convenient transportation in the contemporary.  Actually, I have been making an effort to leave the countryside for a descent and well-paid job. Maybe when I retire from my company, I will go back to the countryside to enjoy the tranquillity with my wife.</p>

In both these conditions, taking the elevator would be traumatically dangerous. And climbing stairs would take many times. Moreover, the food supply in city rely on transporting. If transportation is down because of some reason, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, those residents who are dangerously low in food stores would suffer from starving.  In addition, the population density in the cities are two high, when accidents happen, there may be more people get hurted.</p>

I haven’t put close attention on this problem since I still studying in the college and don’t have my own house. However, personally, it may will take a considerable amount of money to decorate a house from scratch. Everything needs money, the furniture, the appliance, the Internet, the workers. If you want live in a more modern house, with a central control system to intelligently make daily life more easy, it will take extra money to buy the system.</p>

<p>I’d like to talk about an online broadcast that I am really into. Its name is the Chinese Talk Show Conference, a roast competition hosted by Tencent Video. </p>
<p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a time when I couldn’t leave my house and had to stay at home every day. That life was dull and monotonous. Some day, my friend who actually lives in another city invited me to watch an interesting show together through Zoom. </p>
<p>It was more like a comedy show. Everyone, from amateurs to celebrities, as long as they have a talent for comedy and the nerve to deliver a small free-style speech in front of audiences, could attend this conference. </p>
<p>What gave me impressive memory was an American named Jesse Appell. He considered himself a Chinese Comedian since he had lived in Beijing for about seven years and learned Chinese, especially learned Chinese comic cross-talk from a Chinese master.  </p>
<p>He was good at performing stand-up comedy, and his Chinese was incredibly fluent. To break the ice,  he started with the Chinese people’s incredible reactions when they heard he spoke fluent Chinese. Then he compared Chinese and Western eating habits by giving examples of how people eat pizzas in China and how people eat steamed stuffed buns in the USA. Lastly, he ended his performance with his dad’s strange reaction to hearing him answer phones with a Chinese-style start.</p>
<p> (Just as the saying goes, “Comedy is tragedy plus time”, they turn their embarrassed or engaging experience into comedy scripts, then have a speech and laugh it off.) I appreciate that they have shown great courage and confidence in front of audiences. I usually don’t dare to speak with strangers, especially in public. After watching these shows, I am trying to build my confidence and strengthen my courage to speak. </p>

They tend to be emotional and sensitive. Therefore, they have a taste for watching different types of people fall in love, especially those backgrounds that are totally distinctive. On the other hand, most males are very attached to TV series based on history, war, or science fiction since they love shocking and thrilling content. In addition, children have a liking for animation and animal shows since those contents are interesting with funny story or cute animals. </p>

It is a real pleasure and entertainment for many Chinese people to watch foreign TV series since it’s a good chance and opportunity for most people who rarely go abroad to learn about the western cultural. Most people would never have the chance to travel or live in other countries, however, they could experience foreign life by watching their popular shows.  For most Chinese, the earliest foreign TV series must to be Friends and The Big Bang Theory, and I am one of them. We are curious about the life in foreign country. We also are impressed by adorable Sheldon and approachable Leonard. In addition, we could learn knowledge that could not learn from textbooks. For example, Fishing, Man vs. Wild, Sex Education.  </p>

Although animals in zoos tend to have a longer life span with the protection provided by zoos against predators and disease, most of them lose their natural behaviours. In addition, most zoos are designed for entertainment and sighting and sometimes couldn’t provide sufficient space for animals. Seeing their miserable environment in zoos is cruel. On the other hand, animal videos could be made in the wild life or wild conservation areas where animals are naturally born and developed. Watching these videos contributes to children’s better knowledge about animals.</p>

The main reason is that education sector don’t allow schools and teachers to do so since they only consider traditional teaching methods effective and productive. What’s more, most classrooms don’t equip with multi-media players and screens, especially in rural area. Even teachers could show students educational movies, they need to borrow or rent players, which increase the cost and decrease the chance that play videos for students. In addition, some teachers hold the view that students have limited study time in school and it’s wise to use time reasonably, especially for those who will attend College Entrance Exam.</p>

<p>I have met many casual acquaintances in my life and would like to talk about the most impressive one. She is my friend’s cousin, Miss Peng, a master’s degree candidate in France.</p>
<p>I first met her at my friend’s birthday party last summer. She had an hourglass figure and long, sleek, and jet-black hair. She dressed in gorgeous Han Chinese clothing. She performed a western song at the party on a traditional Chinese instrument-guzheng, a Chinese zither. </p>
<p>I was impressed by her ability to transform a Western song to play on the guzheng, which really gave me pleasure and held my attention. I could not envision that “See you again” could be performed that way. A very distinctive tone, many glides, fingerings, and vibrato of guzheng were used to express emotions. They are very well integrated. That was amazingly rocking, and she must be super familiar with this song and good at music. And I think she was an immensely talented young girl. I was overwhelmed with emotions when I heard the lovely sound. </p>
<p>I had no chance to make friends with her because she left the party early. It was disappointing. I really want to know more about her talent.</p>

<p>I had about 20 classmates in my elementary school, and the one impressive person who stuck in my mind was a transfer student in grade 4. She had a catchy name-Yang Yingying, which was easy to remember. She had long, sleek, and jet-black hair. She was approachable, having a radiant smile. </p>
<p>When she transferred to my primary school, my teacher made me her deskmate. Actually, in the beginning, we didn’t talk too much. One day, our teacher didn’t carry her piano to the classroom as usual in the music class. Surprisingly, she brought a rectangular instrument and told us that Yingying would play it for us. We all didn’t see it before and were curious about it. She made an introduction for it - a traditional Chinese instrument -guzheng-also called a Chinese zither. She played a song named “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” for us. The lovely sound and her elegant figure playing guzheng gave me pleasure and held my attention. </p>
<p>In my childhood, we seldom had a chance to learn about an instrument because most of our parents were farmers; I was shocked by her ability to play guzheng. I thought she was an immensely talented young girl.</p>

<p>I listen to upbeat music when I run and soft music when I need to relax. I will share with you a song I love best, and its name is “See you again.” The original version is a film soundtrack of a box-office hit. What’s more, I think a recreation of it by a Chinese student who studies abroad in France is impressive.</p>
<p>The original version is a western pop song and also a massive hit. The adapted version is like Chinese folk music combining Chinese culture and a Western popular song.</p>
<p>I first heard the original version two years ago when I watched the movie. Last month, one of my good friends shared a short video about the adapted song played on the traditional Chinese instrument -guzheng, a Chinese zither. </p>
<p>When I saw this video, I couldn’t envision that “See you again” could be performed that way. The distinctive tone performed by guzheng, many glides, fingerings, and vibrato of guzheng were used to express emotions and are very well integrated. I was overwhelmed with emotions when I heard the lovely sound. It made me remember the days we spent together. I would recommend this recreation to those interested in Chinese culture and Western music.</p>
