<p>In China, it is common to see students working very hard in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/secondary-school">secondary school</a>, but once they <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/step-into">step into</a> a university, they stop making any effort in learning. Instead, they <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/plunge-into">plunge into</a> computer games or parties or anything irrelevant to academic studies.</p>
<p>Why they change dramatically is worth our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/prudent?q=prudent">prudent</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/scrutiny">scrutiny</a>. If students get tired of study, schools should be blamed first. They must done something that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/violate">violates</a> students’ nature, or at least does not encourage or protect their interest in knowledge itself. Students’ negative attitude to study can <u>be explained by the fact</u> in China, the diligence of school students is based on a practical but <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/utilitarian">utilitarian</a> goal -access to a university and a decent job latter, which is highly competitive in current China. They do no study because they like it, but because they have to. That means their interest in study has not been developed well at school.</p>
<p><u>Another reason should also be considered.</u> The rate of university enrolment is the <u>most important <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/criterion">criterion</a> to</u> judge the achievement of a school by the government and the public, and therefore, it is <u>a common strategy</u> for a high school to focus on those subjects that are tested in the entrance exams while ignoring the others. The result of such focus is the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/sacrifice">sacrifice</a> of students’ interests in those less important subjects and extra-curriculum activities as well. School life is boring and students develop a negative attitude towards study <u>as a consequence.</u></p>
<p>However, some measures can be done to encourage students to study. First, the college entrance test system should be reformed. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/on-top-of-sth">On top of</a> the college entrance test scores, other performances should be <u>taken into consideration</u> so as to evaluate a student <u>in a more comprehensive way.</u> The entrance test itself should be flexible and inclusive. Those students who are not good at every subject should be given some option to <u>make up</u> for their weak subject. For instance, those who are poor at maths can be allowed to drop it and add <u>a selective subject</u> that they excel in, like art or music. In that case, students would find school time less pressure and more pleasure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think that the negative attitude towards study is attributed to the education system based on the belief of utilitarianism, misleading students to study for a purpose that has nothing to do with knowledge and self-development. But I assume there are solutions lying in the educators, who can improve the integrative construction of curricular and extra-curricular activities to create an academic environment inspiring student’s interest in study and accepting their preferences.  </p>

<p>Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3yan2yu/pictures/main/202210261607983.png" alt="image-20221026160702923"></p>
<p>The bar chart compares the participation proportion of sports off campus between male and female students in terms of 5 given activities.</p>
<p>Based on the provided statistics, swimming is considered as a well-received choice for both boys and girls, with 13 versus 16 hours per week, respectively. In addition to this, football is too a trendy sporting selection, but only for boys, the number of which in fact precisely indicates the highest value among all. However, football is hardly an interested choice for female participants, with only 4 hours every week, unlike which, netball dominates its popularity among girls, with almost 7 times more than that among boys.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is no apparent difference in basketball section between them, with only one hour in favour of male students (8 hours). Lastly, there are only in total of 9 hours that are not consumed in any sporting activities according to this graph.</p>
