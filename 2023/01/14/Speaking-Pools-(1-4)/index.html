            <h1 id="Part-1"><a href="#Part-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1"></a>Part 1</h1><h2 id="Study"><a href="#Study" class="headerlink" title="Study"></a>Study</h2><h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-work-or-are-you-a-student"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-work-or-are-you-a-student" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Do you work or are you a student?"></a>Part 1 - Do you work or are you a student?</h3><p>I am a student at Chongqing University. I have been doing academic research on the Recommendation System, which is a branch of Machine Learning. In the future, I want to study abroad to have a doctorate.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-What-subject-are-you-studying"><a href="#Part-1-What-subject-are-you-studying" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - What subject are you studying?"></a>Part 1 - What subject are you studying?</h3><p>I am studying software engineering, including the fundamental knowledge of computer, network and software. I also learn some state-of-date concepts such as social network, graph neural network.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Why-did-you-choose-that-subject"><a href="#Part-1-Why-did-you-choose-that-subject" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Why did you choose that subject?"></a>Part 1 - Why did you choose that subject?</h3><p>I used to study electronic engineering when I was in college. Although I did well in my study, I found Artificial Intelligence was so incredible and impressed by its power, such as face recognition. So I began to study it when I started my undergraduate life. </p>
<h3 id="Part-1-What-would-you-like-to-do-in-the-future"><a href="#Part-1-What-would-you-like-to-do-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  What would you like to do in the future?"></a>Part 1 -  What would you like to do in the future?</h3><p>In the near future, I want to study abroad to get a doctorate in computer science. When it comes to the distant future, I prefer to find work which is well-paid and not demanding, such as the instructor at university. I wouldn’t say I like to work in an IT company since most time people have to work overtime.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-What-are-the-most-popular-subjects-in-China"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-the-most-popular-subjects-in-China" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - What are the most popular subjects in China?"></a>Part 1 - What are the most popular subjects in China?</h3><p>For most male students, it must be STEM subjects because it’s their dream to be a scientist. For the majority of female students, education, nursing, and doctors tend to be the most popular since they are more patient and suitable for these.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-think-it’s-important-to-choose-a-subject-you-like"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-think-it’s-important-to-choose-a-subject-you-like" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Do you think it’s important to choose a subject you like?"></a>Part 1 - Do you think it’s important to choose a subject you like?</h3><p>Absolutely yes. A subject I like can motivate me to deal with the problems I encounter. In addition, I will be more interested in discovering this subject’s different aspects. However, I didn’t choose one I liked because my uncle opposed me from learning computer science, and he thought electrical engineering was better. Although I did well in the first two years, I lost interest in the third year and eschewed it whenever possible.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Are-you-looking-forward-to-working"><a href="#Part-1-Are-you-looking-forward-to-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Are you looking forward to working?"></a>Part 1 - Are you looking forward to working?</h3><p>No. I want to study abroad to get a doctorate in computer science. Because my uncle is a Doctor, he always supports and encourages me to progress. And I want to be wise as him. So I decided to follow his example and get my doctorate.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-like-your-subject-Why-x2F-Why-not"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-like-your-subject-Why-x2F-Why-not" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Do you like your subject? (Why? &#x2F; Why not?)"></a>Part 1 - Do you like your subject? (Why? &#x2F; Why not?)</h3><p>Absolutely yes. Although sometimes it’s hard to deal with programming problems, I feel self-fulfilment after working it out. I also like to transfer ideas, such as a smart device, into practice. It’s amazing that I can use this to automate the process of watering flowers.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-prefer-to-study-in-the-mornings-or-in-the-afternoons"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-prefer-to-study-in-the-mornings-or-in-the-afternoons" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Do you prefer to study in the mornings or in the afternoons?"></a>Part 1 - Do you prefer to study in the mornings or in the afternoons?</h3><p>Generally, I love to study in the mornings since I find myself more vibrant, efficient and productive. After lunch, I usually feel tired and will have a snap. However, it’s uneasy to weak up. That’s why I like to study in the morning.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Is-your-subject-interesting-to-you"><a href="#Part-1-Is-your-subject-interesting-to-you" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Is your subject interesting to you?"></a>Part 1 - Is your subject interesting to you?</h3><p>Absolutely yes.

I use a tablet to read papers and take notes. It’s incredibly convenient and efficient because it’s very light and user-friendly. I can easily zoom up to check the details of the graphs in papers. In addition, using a smart pencil, I can mark my notes more clearly. Besides, my eyes don’t feel tired even with excessive screen time.</p>
<h2 id="Hometown"><a href="#Hometown" class="headerlink" title="Hometown"></a>Hometown</h2><p>My hometown is a small, quiet village in central China. The town is by a river with many farmlands. People live on the terrace. It’s extremely beautiful and peaceful, especially in Spring. However, it’s not well developed. The clinic and school are quite simple.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Has-your-hometown-changed-much-these-years"><a href="#Part-1-Has-your-hometown-changed-much-these-years" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  Has your hometown changed much these years?"></a>Part 1 -  Has your hometown changed much these years?</h3><p>Yes, certainly. Thanks to the consistent efforts made in the rural living environments, my hometown has changed significantly in the past decades. When I was a child, the roads used to be ordinary, narrow, and muddy on rainy days. Now, roads are paved with concrete, with flowers and trees on both sides. They are spotlessly clean and wide.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Is-that-a-big-city-or-a-small-place"><a href="#Part-1-Is-that-a-big-city-or-a-small-place" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  Is that a big city or a small place?"></a>Part 1 -  Is that a big city or a small place?</h3><p>My hometown is a small, quiet village in central China.

So I have been living there for, let me see, 20 years. Although it is not developed, I feel it more like a haven that keeps me from the bustle and hustle of busy life in city. </p>
<h3 id="Part-1-For-you-what-benefits-are-there-living-in-a-big-city"><a href="#Part-1-For-you-what-benefits-are-there-living-in-a-big-city" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  For you, what benefits are there living in a big city?"></a>Part 1 -  For you, what benefits are there living in a big city?</h3><p>It must be the advanced education, medical, and city facilities. I have been living in Chongqing for two years. The education system here is relatively<code> /ˈrel.ə.tɪv.li/</code> better than that in my hometown. For example, educators are more knowledgeable. I also can access more resources and have more opportunities to develop myself.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Is-there-anything-you-dislike-about-it"><a href="#Part-1-Is-there-anything-you-dislike-about-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  Is there anything you dislike about it?"></a>Part 1 -  Is there anything you dislike about it?</h3><p>Yes. It’s extremely crowed. There are considerable number of cars in the street, especially in the rush hours. It’s scorching hot in summer. I have to stay in my dorm and turn on air conditioner all day because of the weather. I also don’t get much of appetite.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-What-do-you-like-most-about-your-hometown"><a href="#Part-1-What-do-you-like-most-about-your-hometown" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  What do you like most about your hometown?"></a>Part 1 -  What do you like most about your hometown?</h3><p>It must be the fresh air, the cool breeze and the tranquillity<code>chuankuiletei</code>.  It’s really an excellent resort to kick back. I also like the food and snacks there, especially the dumplings made by my grandmother. </p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Where-in-your-country-do-you-live"><a href="#Part-1-Where-in-your-country-do-you-live" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  Where in your country do you live?"></a>Part 1 -  Where in your country do you live?</h3><h2 id="Accommodation"><a href="#Accommodation" class="headerlink" title="Accommodation"></a>Accommodation</h2><h3 id="Part-1-Are-the-transport-facilities-in-your-city-very-good"><a href="#Part-1-Are-the-transport-facilities-in-your-city-very-good" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  Are the transport facilities in your city very good?"></a>Part 1 -  Are the transport facilities in your city very good?</h3><p>Absolutely yes. We have high-speed trains with great facilities- they are spotlessly clean and amazingly efficient. We also have many metro stations, which is cheap and convenient. There is a incredible station that the metro can cross the apartment.  In addition, in the neighbourhood of our university, we have share-bikes.  </p>

Sometimes we watch movies while eating. Sometimes we talk about the recent news. Besides, we also play games together there. It’s ordinary but cosy<code> /ˈkəʊ.zi</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-live-in-a-house-or-a-flat"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-live-in-a-house-or-a-flat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  Do you live in a house or a flat?"></a>Part 1 -  Do you live in a house or a flat?</h3><p>In fact, I live in the dorm at our university with two roommates. We have a tiny balcony, a small bathroom and our own beds and desks. However, I don’t like to live there because we have different routines. Sometimes I feel disturbed.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-plan-to-live-here-for-a-long-time"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-plan-to-live-here-for-a-long-time" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  Do you plan to live here for a long time?"></a>Part 1 -  Do you plan to live here for a long time?</h3><h3 id="Part-1-Do-you-live-alone-or-with-your-family"><a href="#Part-1-Do-you-live-alone-or-with-your-family" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  Do you live alone or with your family?"></a>Part 1 -  Do you live alone or with your family?</h3><h3 id="Part-1-How-long-have-you-lived-there"><a href="#Part-1-How-long-have-you-lived-there" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  How long have you lived there?"></a>Part 1 -  How long have you lived there?</h3><h3 id="Part-1-What-do-you-usually-do-in-your-house-x2F-flat-x2F-room"><a href="#Part-1-What-do-you-usually-do-in-your-house-x2F-flat-x2F-room" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  What do you usually do in your house&#x2F;flat&#x2F;room?"></a>Part 1 -  What do you usually do in your house&#x2F;flat&#x2F;room?</h3><p>I seldom stay in my room because I like to stay in the library for free electricity. I usually shower and go to bed when I am in the dorm. After watching some short videos, I begin to sleep.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Which-is-your-favourite-room-in-your-home"><a href="#Part-1-Which-is-your-favourite-room-in-your-home" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  Which is your favourite room in your home?"></a>Part 1 -  Which is your favourite room in your home?</h3><p>It must be my bedroom. There is a large desk where I usually read books. It’s really peaceful. It’s more like a haven and helps me relieve my stress and pressure. Sometimes I just lay on the bed and watch movies or listen to music. </p>
<h3 id="Part-1-What’s-the-difference-between-where-you-are-living-now-and-where-you-lived-in-the-past-If-you-want-to-say-you-have-not-lived-elsewhere"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-difference-between-where-you-are-living-now-and-where-you-lived-in-the-past-If-you-want-to-say-you-have-not-lived-elsewhere" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  What’s the difference between where you are living now and where you lived in the past?

(If you want to say you have not lived elsewhere)</h3><p>I used to live in a small village, and I currently live in Chongqing. On the one hand, Chongqing is more developed. The transport system here is more advanced. There are many restaurants, cinemas, concerts, and you name it. On the other hand, however, it’s crowded. There are too many cars in the street, especially during rush hour. </p>

Why?"></a>Part 1 - Do you like singing? Why?</h3><p>Actually, I am not fond of singing, and I always keep a low profile when it comes to singing. Probably, because I was never expose to music. In addition, I’m completely tone-deaf and I sing off-key(out of tune). I could still remember when I was in grade 6, my music teacher asked me to sing in front of the class. However, I told her that I didn’t have a good voice. As a result, she punished me and made me stand in my desk the entire class. I felt so embarrassed<code> /ɪmˈbær.əst/</code> that I developed an anxiety<code> /æŋˈzaɪ.ə.ti/</code> to sing. That’s why, I don’t like singing and eschew<code> /ɪsˈtʃuː/</code> it whenever possible. </p>

It’s ironic<code> /aɪˈrɒn.ɪk/airuoneike</code> to say yes to this question because as  what I’ve said, I’m not into singing. Yet, when I was in college, I had a crush<code>/krʌʃ/</code> on a young singer in our campus<code> /ˈkæm.pəs/</code>, who inspired me to learn singing. I did not have a formal voice lessons, but I tried to practice it by watching videos online. However, the feeling was not mutual<code> /ˈmjuː.tʃu.əl/miuchuou</code>. She told me that I wasn’t her type. The unrequited<code>/ˌʌn.rɪˈkwaɪ.tɪd/unruikuaiteide</code> love wrecked<code> /rekt/</code> me emotionally, so I gave it up.   </p>

She was my ideal girlfriend because she has all the qualities<code>/ˈkwɒl.ə.ti/kuoleiteisi</code> a man would look for. However, I didn’t have the courage<code> /ˈkʌr.ɪdʒ/</code> to sing in front of her, because of the fact that I don’t have that kind of talent.  But, if I have a sweet-sounding<code>/swiːt/``/saʊnd/</code> voice, I would have sung<code>sangge</code> for that girl to express my feelings.  </p>

Although I don’t like to sing, it’s quite evident<code> /ˈev.ɪ.dənt/</code> that it brings joy to some people, most especially to those who have this kind of talent. For instance, people who are undergoing a lot of stress would probably go out and spend time singing in a Karaoke<code> /ˌkær.iˈəʊ.ki/karuioukei</code> bar with  their peers to give vent<code>/vent/</code> out their frustrations<code>/frʌsˈtreɪ.ʃən/furuasizhuishen</code>. Furthermore, if they can relate<code> /rɪˈleɪt/</code> to the lyrics<code>/ˈlɪr.ɪk/leiruike</code> of the song, they would feel more relax and at ease. Moreover, I really like a singer named Zhou Shen. His songs always  inspires and relieves me.   </p>

I actually study intensely every week. At the beginning of the week, I make to-do lists. In addition, I need to read essays and take notes every day. What’s more, I also write assignments because they’re part of the criteria of my study. Besides, sometimes I add captions to my WeChat moments after running.</p>

The longer, the better. Besides, I seldom come back to my hometown to have a good square meal with my mother, so on my birthday, I also call her to express my love and miss.</p>

So I didn’t have much time to do many things. My father would prepare a good square meal for me, which was a pleasant time because I could eat a lot of chicken, and after that, I had to come back to school to finish the afternoon classes. Besides, I always had a good mood because I am grown up.</p>

Because I am already an adult and it’s no need to spare time to celebrate it anymore. However, I think it’s an excellent time to express my love to my mother. Because I know how difficult and complex childbearing and childrearing are. I appreciate what she has done. So it’s meaningful to show how I appreciate her love on my birthday. </p>

I think geography is quite interesting and essential, especially physical geography. Things like natural environment and the planet are significant. In addition, I am concerned about climate change, ecosystems and environmental problems happening in our global. Therefore, I develop a liking for geography.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Have-you-ever-studied-geography-at-school"><a href="#Part-1-Have-you-ever-studied-geography-at-school" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 -  Have you ever studied geography at school?"></a>Part 1 -  Have you ever studied geography at school?</h3><p>Absolutely. Geography is one of the national curriculums in our country. I still remember that my teachers taught us that how to calculate a surface area by measuring degrees and lengths, how to understand topics like ocean circulation, acid rains. Some of mathematical formulates are very difficult and abstract, so I didn’t get a good score in geography. </p>
<p>Absolutely yes! Geography is a <strong>compulsory<code>/kəmˈpʌl.sər.i/</code> subject</strong> in my country. </p>
<p>Description: I still remember we had to <strong>rack our brains</strong> to memorize and calculate the position or location of any place on Earth’s surface. Our teachers even taught us ocean circulation patterns and <strong>acid</strong> rains. </p>
<p>Conclusion: It was <strong>painstaking<code>/ˈpeɪnzˌteɪ.kɪŋ/</code></strong> so; I didn’t get a good score in <strong>geography</strong>.</p>

Because rarely did I have occasion to practice this skill. Firstly, I often stay in a certain place for years. Moreover, I need to input the destination on my phone, and it will calculate the route for me. So I think modern technologies are more beneficial than the traditional way of finding places.</p>

I lived in inland China, and I felt a yearning for the beach since I never had the chance to visit it. When I found Coromandel online, I was impressed of its spectacular<code> /spekˈtæk.jə.lər/</code> coastal walkway, hot water beach and other attractions. The most scenic site that I want to tour is their famous cove, where I can take a boat and a local tourist guide.</p>

I did many puzzles<code>/ˈpʌz.əl/</code> when I was a child such as Crossword, Jigsaw<code>/ˈdʒɪɡ.sɔː/</code>, Chinese riddle<code>/ˈrɪd.əl/</code>, Magic square, and Sudoku<code>/suˈdəʊ.kuː/</code>.  Among them, I was crazy about Sudoku. It is a number game where we need to fill all the empty<code> /ˈemp.ti/</code> squares with numbers according to the hints<code>/hɪnt/</code> that you can see in every line since there are already digits<code>/ˈdɪdʒ.ɪt/</code> that will be set out on the grids. All I need to do is to make sure that I are not repeating the same numbers ranging from 1-9 in each row and column<code>/ˈkɒl.əm/</code>. Although, it is difficult and time-consuming, I still enjoyed it because it was mind-challenging<code>/ˈtʃæl.ɪn.dʒɪŋ/</code> and thrilling<code> /ˈθrɪl.ɪŋ/siruiling</code>. I always get the experience of fulfilment<code> /fʊlˈfɪl.mənt/</code> once I solve the puzzle immediately<code>/ɪˈmiː.di.ət.li/</code>.   </p>

To be honest, I only play puzzles when I have the pleasure to do so since I am no longer interested in them. For instance, when I read newspapers and magazines I  sometimes run into Sudoku and that’s the only time I try to solve<code> /sɒlv/sevu</code> it. In addition, there are more entertaining<code> /en.təˈteɪ.nɪŋ/enteteining</code> games that can be found on the internet such as the mini-games in WeChat, where I can play and share with my social media friends conveniently<code> /kənˈviː.ni.ənt.li/kenvinientalei</code>. Therefore, I seldom take part in mind-altering games such as puzzles because of the overwhelming<code> /ˌəʊ.vəˈwel.mɪŋ/ouwowelming</code> content of online platforms.   </p>

I can still remember when our teacher used to ask the class riddles as an ice breaker. Once we guess it correctly<code> /kəˈrekt.li/</code>, we will receive a prize. Since, I am not good at word games, it was hard for me to win a reward. Solving riddles is as hard as managing conflicts since I need to think critically and train my thought to come up with the right answer. On the other hand, number puzzles are easier since there is no need for us to examine a problem, all we have to do is to list down possible answers directly to get an accurate result.   </p>

Puzzles can help prevent old people from acquiring serious<code> /ˈsɪə.ri.əs/</code> brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s<code>ˈ/ɔltsˌhɑɪ·mərz/oucihaimozi</code>  which often happens because of their age. When playing these games, they not only exercise their brain and improve their memory but also, maintain their ability to handle complex tasks and strengthen<code>/ˈstreŋ.θən/sizhunsen</code> their reasoning<code>/ˈriː.zən.ɪŋ/ruizenning</code> skills.  In addition, together with aerobic<code> /eəˈrəʊ.bɪk/airoubeike</code> exercise, the elderly can build up stronger mental and physical health since it releases<code> /rɪˈliːs/ruiliseisi</code> the tension<code>/ˈten.ʃən/ </code> they feel in their brain when they are under stress.</p>

My name means looking at the star. My mom used to tell me that she likes to watch the starry<code> /ˈstɑː.ri/ sidarui</code> sky. She is a farmer and she is working in the field all day. Besides, she can only rest after doing her daily chores<code>/tʃɔːr/</code>. <strong>After a long day at work</strong>, she usually lays down on the recliner<code>/rɪˈklaɪ.nər/</code> on the balcony<code>/ˈbæl.kə.ni/</code>, watching the stars above her to relieve her feeling.  That’s how my name was created, and she wished that I could forget my exhaustion<code>/ɪɡˈzɔːs.tʃən/</code> when looking at the starry night.</p>

They just create it randomly. As a matter of fact, Chinese characters have corresponding<code>/ˌkɒr.ɪˈspɒn.dɪŋ/</code> meanings, so they focus on names that have positive connotations<code>/ˌkɒn.əˈteɪ.ʃən/</code>. Nevertheless<code>/ˌnev.ə.ðəˈles/neiveleisi</code>, I want my children to be named after the words related to study since I realized that education is significant.</p>

Based on my experience, there is a custom practiced by my extended family to not have the same names. Unlike other families, they don’t care whether their children or relatives have the same identity. However, in our case, children are not allowed to own identical names as their relatives, because they consider this as a disrespectful behaviour. I still remember that my uncle changed his son’s name simply because one word in my name was the same as my cousin’s. Personally, this is unreasonable and pedantic. </p>

Nowadays, due to the influence of cyber-culture, young couples create names that are more modern and non-mainstream for their children.</p>

Because public transportation, such as the subway and bus, is inconvenient and crowded.

I always eat them with my friends after class every day when I was still in grade school. We used to share our snacks to each other so that we can consume more foods during recess<code> /rɪˈses/</code>.

However, when my friends buy some light meals and they share them with me, I just eat a little. Besides, I seem to lose interest in snacks although I have more chance and money to buy them. I think it’s better to go to a restaurant because they serve<code> /sɜːv/</code> delicious foods.</p>
<p>However, sometimes my friends and I eat China skewers at food booths set up along both sides of the street. It’s a pleasure to grab skewers filled with lamb, beef, chicken wings or vegetables on the road on a summer night.</p>

<p>I want to talk about a British person I know from the news. He is Stephen Ellison, British Consul-General in Chongqing. I think he is brave.</p>
<p>He once saved a drowning student when he was walking by a river in a nearby village. A girl accidentally fell into the fast-moving current and lost consciousness. He, without hesitation, took off his shoes, dived into the river, and saved that girl. When he accessed her, he found her not breathing. Luckily, as they went back to the side, she started breathing again and was shaken by the experience. But she was extremely grateful and invited him to have dinner with her family. I was so impressed by his brave and good-hearted behaviour.</p>
<p>I also learned that he used to work on the planning and construction of some major transportation projects, such as the Hong Kong-Macau-Zhuhai Crossing. He is so amazing and professional. </p>
<p>He is really into skiing and cycling and once drove a motorcycle across the Himalayas. He also took part in triathlons and won first place. </p>
<p>I think he is an incredible man.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p> I’d like to talk about one of my classmates in college who likes to dress fashionably<code> /ˈfæʃ.ən.ə.bli/fashenebolei</code>.  She is well-known as, Yingying.  She is pretty tall and absolutely gorgeous.  She has a long, jet-black hair. She actually bears a striking<code>/ˈstraɪ.kɪŋ/</code> resemblance<code> /rɪˈzem.bləns/</code> of a famous Chinese singer. She probably needs to maintain all of these qualities because she is a vlogger. She earns a little extra  money by sharing her videos about beautiful dresses and she posts them on her social media accounts. Then, she will buy new clothes again and advertise<code> /ˈæd.və.taɪz/</code> them online.  </p>
<p>She is crazy about the Chinese traditional culture<code> /ˈkʌl.tʃər/kouqie</code> and is a big fan of ancient Chinese outfit such as Hanfu and Qipao. Hanfu is the oldest form of clothing in China, adopted and vigorously<code> /ˈvɪɡ.ər.əs.li/weigeresilei</code> promoted by the ruling class of Han dynasty<code>/ˈdɪn.ə.sti/</code>.  On the other hand, Qipao, also named as cheongsam<code> /ˌtʃɒŋˈsæm/changsamu</code>,  is the most famous traditional clothing that originated<code> /əˈrɪdʒ.ən.eɪt/ouruijinneiteide</code> in Shanghai in the 1920s. It quickly became a fashion phenomenon<code> /fəˈnɒm.ɪ.nən/feinomeinen</code> that was adopted by movie stars and schoolgirls alike<code>/əˈlaɪk/</code>.     </p>
<p>Based on her videos, I would say that she really appreciates<code> /əˈpriː.ʃi.eɪt/epuruisheieici</code> Chinese culture. That’s why, she’s into traditional style<code> /staɪl/</code>. Unlike the younger generation<code> /ˌdʒen.əˈreɪ.ʃən/jinneruishen</code> of today’s society,  she prefers to wear these attire<code> /əˈtaɪər/</code> to promote<code> /prəˈməʊt/</code> cultural relativism<code>/ˈrel.ə.tɪ.vɪ.zəm/rueileiteiweizemu</code>.  She wants to spread it, so that the whole world can recognise its significance<code> /sɪɡˈnɪf.ɪ.kəns/seigeneifukensi</code> to our history by making vlogs<code>/vlɒɡ/</code>.  She thinks the Hanfu and Qipao are spectacular and pleasant to wear.  She always shares videos about the amazing Chinese ancient dress-up with beautiful hairstyles on the internet.  In addition, she said that wearing these clothes would bring her more confidence and can help her establish<code> /ɪˈstæb.lɪʃ/</code> good connection with other fashion-loving people.  Therefore, I consider her as a huge fan of fashion industry, especially Chinese ancient clothing.  </p>

Why?"></a>Part 3 - Do you think online shopping will replace in-store shopping in the future? Why?</h4><p> I doubt that in-store shopping will be replaced by online shopping. Shopping online nowadays is incredibly<code> /ɪnˈkred.ə.bli/incerueidebelei</code> convenient, more efficient and faster than before because of the advancement in delivery<code> /dɪˈlɪv.ər.i/diliwurui</code> and websites.  Moreover, people don’t need to leave their house since they can just get what  they want from various<code>/ˈveə.ri.əs/</code> applications on their smartphones and stuffs will be  transported within a few days. If they are not satisfied with the products, they can return them and get a refund<code> /ˈriː.fʌnd/</code> right away. On the other hand, some people like strolling at the mall<code> /mɔːl/</code>, street markets and so on. They tend to test the products personally<code>/ˈpɜː.sən.əl.i/</code> to ensure their quality<code>/ˈkwɒl.ə.ti/</code>. In addition, with the help of a friendly and knowledgeable sales associate<code> /əˈsəʊ.ʃi.ət/esoushierta</code> and an up-close look at the goods, consumers would have a more excellent personal shopping experience in the brick-and-mortar<code> /ˌbrɪk.ənˈmɔː.tər/</code> retailer<code>/ˈriː.teɪ.lər/</code>. So,  it depends on the preferences<code>/ˈpref.ər.əns/purueiferunsi</code> of the people.  </p>

They believed that it speaks about their personality and attitude. For example, a person would consider wearing a professional<code> /prəˈfeʃ.ən.əl/</code> attire<code> /əˈtaɪər/</code> when attending a job interview to form a good impression. This will also boost their self-confidence and self-esteem<code> /ˌself.ɪˈstiːm/</code> because they are pleasant to look at. The way they dress allows potential employers to consider their application because of how they present themselves professionally<code> /prəˈfeʃ.ən.əl.i/</code>. Another thing, people just want to hear positive  comments from others because of their looks. Therefore, I can say that we have different views when it comes to fashion, depending on its necessity<code> /nəˈses.ə.ti/</code> in our situation.   </p>

They have less chance to keep up with the fashion trend because they may not understand how to use the new gadgets<code> /ˈɡædʒ.ɪt/</code>. Youngsters<code> /ˈjʌŋ.stər/yangsita</code> are more skilful and adaptable<code>/əˈdæp.tə.bəl/edaputebou</code> to change.

Why?"></a>Part 3 - Are women more fashionable than men? Why?</h4><p>Answer  structure: Response + Reason + Example + Conclusion</p>
<p> Totally! Women are particular when it comes to the clothes they wear compared to men. This is because they are more likely pressured to keep up with their friends or acquaintances’<code>/əˈkweɪn.təns/akuoentenseisi</code> trendy<code> /ˈtren.di/</code> outfits. On the other hand, we don’t spend too much effort on choosing which clothes to wear. As long as it is comfortable and neat then it would be enough. For instance, women would take a lot of time to dress-up and would complain if they are wearing the same style. Although it is not necessary, yet they would argue to be different from others specially when they are attending important events. In addition, they perceive<code> /pəˈsiːv/</code> fashion as a competition<code> /ˌkɒm.pəˈtɪʃ.ən/kangmupoteishen</code> against other women. That’s why, women are more fashion-minded and pay more attention on how they look.   </p>

<p>Actually, everyone I know in my hometown could grow plants well; however, when it comes to a person who is really into growing plants, it must be my grandmother. </p>
<p>My grandmother is a traditional Chinese farmer. She was born in about 1947 and didn’t know her actual birthday because her parents had many children then and couldn’t remember. She is extremely considerate, sensitive and approachable. </p>
<p>She has a small yard in front of her house, where she always grows plants. She really has green fingers and is fond of growing plants. She plants vegetables according to seasons. In Spring, she often grows warm-season vegetables such as cucumbers, Chinese eggplants, tomatoes, bitter melon, potatoes and so on. When autumn comes, she plants some cold-season crops, like white radish, Chinese cabbage, spring onion, garlic, you name it. Sometimes, she grows some flowers that I don’t know their names, but my grandmother often uses them to paint her fingernails.<br>What’s more, she once planted a cherry tree. I still remember when I was about six years old, I would become an avid eater of cherries in July. That was an absolute happy time. Every time the cherries turned red and were ripe, I tried to climb the tree but failed since I was too short at that time to get the branch. Then my grandfather would lift me to pick them up. However, it was removed when I could climb that tree because my grandparents needed to reconstruct their house.</p>
<p>At my grandmother’s early age, growing was a skill that every farmer must master. They grow crops and plants for life. It gradually turns into her lifelong habit. She is fond of growing since she likes the sense of self-sufficiency. </p>

<p>I have two neighbours in my hometown and Miss. Peng is undoubtedly an interesting person.</p>
<p>She is pretty tall and absolutely gorgeous. She has long, sleek, and jet-black hair. What important is that her fingers are long, delicate, and smooth, which is why she is good at playing a traditional Chinese instrument-guzheng- in other words, the Chinese zither.</p>
<p>I first knew her about, let me see, twelve years ago, when she came back home for vacation. She had been learning music at the Central Conservatory of Music for five years, and even on holiday, she chose to stay at university to practice guzheng.</p>
<p>She would play guzheng every morning, and I woke up to the lovely sound. What was extremely interesting was that one day, I saw her dressed beautifully in her hanfu, recreating current, popular, western music on guzheng. I just couldn’t envision that <strong>see you again</strong> could be performed like that. A very distinctive tone, many glides, fingerings, and vibrato of guzheng were used to express emotions. They are very well integrated. That was awesome and rocking, and she must be super familiar with that song. The ability to transform a Western song to play on the guzheng really gave me pleasure and held my attention. </p>

<p> I am really into recording life by taking photos. And I would like to talk about a photograph I took two years ago on campus.</p>
<p>It was a good day with warm sunshine and a slight wind, and I had classes all day. </p>
<p>After lunch, we had some time to rest. So my friends and I decided to stroll along our university and soak up the sun. When we wandered around the lake near the library, we saw two swans resting on the shore, full of freedom and peacefulness. That was so lovely that I took my cellphone and tried to capture this beautiful moment. It was right around that time one swan was unfolding its wings and wanted to fly, and I shot it. It was the most incredible picture that I had taken. With a library and a sparkling lake as background, the swan on the wing gave us a sense of gain. Then I shared it in my WeChat moment and received several comments and likes. Even my tutors gave me a like in WeChat. I was on could nine because so many people liked the photos. </p>
<p>A few days later, our university held a photography competition, and I used this photo to participate. Finally, I got a second award. I was thrilled and proud of myself.</p>
<p>What I have forgotten to tell you? Let me see, Yes. When taking part in the competition, I told my friends and classmates that I needed them vote for me. And they all were willing to do so. With the help of them, you can’t believe it, I got 500 supporters.</p>

<p>I’d like to talk about a sports watch which I found in a shop. When I saw it I immediately thought it was extremely beautiful because I felt comfortable when I tried to wear it.</p>
<p>It has a 42 millimetre circle dial which supports slide and touch gestures, as well as a light-weight strap. It also has many features, such as scientific running system, accurate real-time heart rate. More specifically, it can help people to advance their running by designing a tailor-made exercise plan, recording running data, and providing suggestions. In addition, it also can record steps, sleeps, and wake people up in the morning.</p>
<p>I thought it was incredible after the seller introduced it. And I bought one because I had the  need to runner faster and healthier.</p>

<p>I want to talk about a movie I watched a few months ago. It was a black comedy with some touching scenes. It makes me feel a roller coaster of emotions, so I want to watch it again.</p>
<p>I was going through the busiest time of the year and was desperate for a break. So I decided to watch a film in the cinema that is not far from our college. The movie was Moon Man. It was about a man who was left on the moon and strived to live alone. The role repeatedly experienced an emotional wreck and a ray of hope. When he knew he was left on the moon, he was angry since nobody informed him about retreatment. Then he was frustrated seeing a planet hit the earth because he was the only one who survived. In the beginning, he gradually gave up hope of striving. He then figured out how to return to the earth and became happy. However, he became upset again because it was hard to fix up equipment. When he finally made everything ok and was ready to travel back to earth, he found another planet was about to hit the ground. He decided to sacrifice himself to save people on earth. </p>
<p>My mood changed according to the scenes. I laughed, then cried, then repeated. It was an excellent movie, so I would like to watch it again.</p>

<p>About one year ago, I learned an essential thing through a road accident. That is, Do not be distracted when riding a bike. </p>
<p>One day last summer holiday, it was rainy and gloomy. My tutor invited some classmates, including my girlfriend and me, to have dinner at his house. We planned to ride an E-bike because it was not far from our university. However, she wanted to sit in front of the bike, which was dangerous behaviour, especially in this lousy weather. Even though I knew it was unsafe, I could not reason with her. So we did so. However, we hit another E-bike at a corner because I had poor vision and was talking with her while riding. That guy didn’t hurt, and we didn’t have conflict. However, my girlfriend was injured in her ankle.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it was unfortunate because my sweetheart hurt her ankle. On the other hand, I thought it was lucky that we didn’t encounter a breakneck car or truck because we might die.  </p>
<p>This awful experience taught me a lesson. I made us at risk of being killed by accident because I didn’t observe the traffic law and was distracted by other things. From then on, I swear I would never be preoccupied when riding a bike. Besides, I would observe traffic law.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I read a short story about the difference between an economist and other occupations. It is exciting because it uses understandable language to reveal the complex concept of economics and inspired me to learn the common sense of economics. </p>
<p>It was a story from a book named Funny Stories of the Economist, whose author is Wang ruize. It was about a mathematician, an accountant and an economist applying for the same job. The interviewer asks them an identical question about what two plus two equals. The mathematician looks at the interviewer and straightforwardly replies: “Four, exactly!” However, when the accountant is asked this question, he says, “On average, four, give or take ten per cent, but average, four.” When the economist has posed this question, he gets up, locks the door, closes the shade, sits down next to the interviewer and says, “What do you want it to be equal?”</p>
<p>Wow, it is so funny and interesting. After a laugh, I get the author’s viewpoint and how complex and different the economy is. It inspires me with an interest in economics. Since then, I have begun to read more fun facts about economics.</p>

<p>I listen to upbeat music when I run and soft music when I need to relax. I will share with you a song I love best, and its name is “See you again.” The original version is a film soundtrack of a box-office hit. What’s more, I think a recreation of it by a Chinese student who studies abroad in France is impressive.</p>
<p>The original version is a western pop song and also a massive hit. The adapted version is like Chinese folk music combining Chinese culture and a Western popular song.</p>
<p>I first heard the original version two years ago when I watched the movie. Last month, one of my good friends shared a short video about the adapted song played on the traditional Chinese instrument -guzheng, a Chinese zither. </p>
<p>When I saw this video, I couldn’t envision that “See you again” could be performed that way. The distinctive tone performed by guzheng, many glides, fingerings, and vibrato of guzheng were used to express emotions and are very well integrated. I was overwhelmed with emotions when I heard the lovely sound. It made me remember the days we spent together. I would recommend this recreation to those interested in Chinese culture and Western music.</p>

<p>I want to talk about our playground which is also a popular site for students to do physical activities.</p>
<p>I actually go there twice week to run. Just a few days ago, I went there again to do my usual routine. It is set in a wonderful spot in the north of my campus. The area quite broad with six basketball and four tennis courts, and two football pitches. A running track is laid out enclosing the football field. There is also a lake nearby with beautiful flowers, swans and koi with various colours.</p>
<p>Last time, I went there and did a high-intensity interval training. It is a kind of physical training <strong>consisting</strong> of short periods of <strong>intense</strong> exercise with a little time of rest in a single interval. I usually do four intervals, and each includes fast running and jogging. It requires a lot of energy so it’s exhausting, particularly in the last terms. However, every time I finish it, I find self-fulfilment. I don’t have many close friends to <strong>accompany</strong> me to do other exercises and daily study routine is excessively repetitive and tedious. Only when I put on my earphones and run at night, I find the new meaning of life.</p>
<p>Like other students who are also loving this haven, we exercise to find meaning, cope with pressure and stress, or enjoy leisure from the <strong>hustle and bustle</strong> of daily life.</p>

<p>Based on my observation, young people are really into sports such as running, cycling, playing football, basketball, name it. This is because it is a way for them to find pleasure and extend their social circle. What’s more, these activities require strenuous movements and physical contact. So, when youngsters involve themselves in such kinds of undertakings, it shows how vigorous and energetic they are. In addition, it also keeps them from excessive screen time to avoid detrimental effects on their body. </p>
<p>So, sports participation not only promotes physical wellbeing but also builds confidence, can maintain mental health and develop a beneficial lifestyle. </p>

<p><strong>Order of adjectives - a  classical blue Chinese brick rural house</strong>     </p>
<p><strong>Determiner, opinion, size,  physical quality, shape, age, colour, origin, material, type, purpose, noun</strong>    </p>
<p>Actually, I have been staying in Chongqing for about two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic and have never left the city. But I’d like to talk about my grandparents’ home where I usually went every week before when I was young yet, now I only visit it during important events.  </p>
<p>My grandparents live in the countryside of central China. Their house is a classical blue Chinese brick rural house, designed by themselves. The main body was built with bricks and the roof was constructed with tiles. The roof is intersecting, and we commonly call it as - “Ren”- in  Chinese which means people. They also have a small yard in the front, a red-cemented<code> /sɪˈment/sementeide</code> kitchen, and a spot for watchdog.      </p>
<p>My grandmother is really into growing plants in the yard. She plants cold and warm-season vegetables according to the quarter<code> /ˈkwɔː.tər/kuote</code>, such as Chinese cabbage, potatoes, cucumbers<code>/ˈkjuː.kʌm.bər/ </code>, Chinese eggplants, white radishes, tomatoes, bitter melons, you name it. In addition, there used to be a cherry tree and a small rabbit farm. We harvested<code> /ˈhɑː.vɪst/haweisiteide</code> ripe<code> /raɪp/</code> cherries in July and I eventually became an avid<code>/ˈæv.ɪd/</code> eater of cherries. Moreover, they made extra money by selling rabbits’ hair. However, when I grew up, the cherry tree and rabbit house were removed for some reason.  Those were absolutely the happiest time of my life.       </p>
<p>Actually, their house is extremely ordinary and conservative.  Also, there is no WiFi<code> /ˈwaɪ.faɪ/</code>, so it is really inconvenient<code>/ˌɪn.kənˈviː.ni.ənt/yinkenviniente</code> to use smartphones because of the terrible phone service<code>/ˈsɜː.vɪs/</code>.

<p>I want to recommend Chongqing to those who wish to have a distinctive experience. Chongqing is a beautiful tourist resort set in southwest China with astounding beauty.</p>
<p>It’s a fast-growing city with both enthralling urban cityscape and traditional cultural elements. People can experience many featured modern mountain buildings with fantastic geography and skyline. In addition, they also can find traditional Chinese architecture well-kept in the bustling city. </p>
<p>The first thing people can do, and I strongly recommend, eat hotpots. Hotpot is not only a food but also a lifestyle. People can see hotpots in every street in Chongqing, and Chongqing people eat them almost daily. It’s a pot of boiling soup that people can put vegetables and meat into and cook them. It’s super spicy but incredibly delicious.</p>
<p>The second thing people can do is visit the charming and stunning cityscape. There is an excellent activity in that people experience the house-crossing metro running through a modern flat.</p>
<p>Other things, such as taking a cruise in the Yangtze river and visiting Hongya Cave, are also recommended.</p>

<p>Actually, I have been staying at our university because of COVID-19 pandemic. I want to talk about our playground which is also a popular site for students to do physical activities.</p>
<p>I went there just a few days ago and I go running there about twice a week. It is a wonderful spot set in the north of my campus. It is quite a broad area with six basketball courts, four tennis courts and two football courts. Circled with football courts is the racetrack. There is also a lake nearby with beautiful flowers, swans and koi that are various colours.</p>
<p>Last time I went there and went high-intensity interval training, short for HIIT.  HIIT is a kind of physical training consisting of short periods of intense exercise with short periods of rest in a single interval.  I usually do four intervals, and each interval is made up of fast running and jogging. It’s very energetic, exhausted, particularly in the last terms. However, every time I finish that, I find self-fulfilment. I don’t have many close friends to company me to do other exercises and everyday study life is excessively repeated and tedious. Only when I put on my earphones and run in the night, I find the new meaning of life. </p>
<p>Like other students who also like this haven, we exercise to find meaning, give our pressure and stress out, or enjoy leisure from the hustle and bustle of daily life. </p>

<p>I want to share an awful<code>/ˈɔː.fəl/</code> experience when I bought some memory cards online about ten years ago. </p>
<p>One day in high school, while surfing Taobao, I found some memory cards were selling at a very low discount. I could not imagine that I could own a 128GB<code> /ˈɡɪɡ.ə.baɪt/geigebaite</code> card just for 40 Chinese Yuan. In an excited mood, I ordered two cards. This package was delivered from Guangdong province and was incredibly faster than usual. After I received them, I showed off to my friends. As a result, my friends also wanted to have one. However, the seller closed the URL. And I didn’t realise that he had fooled me. Instead, I thought it was a real bargain.</p>
<p>However, when I tried to save more videos, my computer told me that my drive was corrupted and must be formatted before it could be used again. What’s worse, the previous data was lost. At that time, I knew I had bought a fake. Unscrupulous<code>/ʌnˈskruː.pjə.ləs/ansikurupiulesi</code> manufacturers intentionally modified the memory cards to report the unreal capacity<code> /kəˈpæs.ə.ti/kepasetei</code>. Sadly, I found the store had been closed, and I couldn’t get my money back.</p>
<p>I felt angry with these fraudsters<code>/ˈfrɔːd.stər/</code> because they hurt my trust. In addition, I thought I was silly. I should have checked this store repeatedly because it’s very much a “buyer beware” when buying things at an unrealistic<code> /ˌʌn.rɪəˈlɪs.tɪk/</code> price.</p>

<p>About four years ago, I decided to better myself and waited for a soul mate who understood and loved me in the future because a girl rejected me because I wasn’t her type then.</p>
<p>I was painfully shy when I was young and afraid of talking to others because I had low self-esteem. Even when I went to college, I still didn’t want to make more friends and kept a low profile. What I usually did was find a peaceful corner and study. However, someday a girl wanted me to help her with mathematical work because only I could correctly answer the lecturer’s questions in class. I was blissfully happy that I could help her. Sometimes we also strolled on our campus. After becoming familiar, we found we had many identical interests and characters.<br>All in all, we together had a happy time. But when I asked her to be my girlfriend, she told me that I wasn’t her type and she liked extroverts who loved exercise. And we gradually didn’t talk anymore. I felt an emotional wreck and went back into my shell. </p>
<p>So when I realized I didn’t deserve love, I decided I would like to better myself and waited to encounter a soul mate who had a mutual feeling and could bring me out of my shell. I felt sad but also confident. I began to do exercise and tried to be more energetic. I thought I would have chance to meet my girl in the future.</p>

<p>Actually, there were several times I received money as gifts. However, I want to talk about the most broken-hearted and meaningful one. About three years ago, my grandfather gave me 50,000 Chinese yuan and wanted me to make good use of it.</p>
<p>On 25 December 2019, I got a call from my grandmother, who was audible of sadness. She said my grandpa was not doing well and wanted my family to visit them. When we got there, I saw him lying on the bed with a pale face. I got close to him and asked how he felt. He told me he might not make it, and he handed me a deposit card to me. He said it was a gift to celebrate my qualification to pursue my master’s degree in Chongqing. He also wanted me to make good use of this legacy and get a doctorate in the future.</p>
<p>That time I experienced a roller coaster of emotions. I felt an emotional wreck because I could not see my grandpa anymore. I didn’t want to lose him because he was very friendly and approachable, and he gave me a carefree childhood. In addition, I was overwhelmed with appreciation. My grandpa was a farmer and incredibly economical with life. I could not image that he had been scrimping and saving to fund my education. However, he gave me so substantial money to encourage me to make more effort to study. I was very touched by this gift and told him I would channel all that effort into studying. </p>

<p>Just a few days ago, I fought with my girlfriend about she didn’t understand me. I felt an emotional wreck about this experience.</p>
<p>I had been preparing for IELTS since August and reserved an exam on November 7. However, at the end of October, I found that I didn’t have expertise in listening and needed more time to practice it. So I was wondering whether I should change the test day. When I told my college sweetheart, she didn’t think anything but criticised me for wasting money without hesitation. At first, I felt upset and tried to explain her reasons and advantages. However, she didn’t listen to me and continued to ridicule me because she thought I didn’t make a total effort to study and didn’t give full consideration when I reserved the exam. Then I lost my temper and told her that she didn’t understand how difficult to get a satisfying score in IELTS because she always blindly thought it was easy to do anything. </p>
<p>In the night, when I calmed down, I knew that I just felt stressed and wanted her to give me comfort instead of judging me. Then I recalled the methods I learned from a book named nonviolent communication. So I clearly expressed my thoughts and needs to her, and she realised she had no consideration for me. At last, we kissed and made up, as usual.</p>

<p>I still remembered the disagreement that I had with my younger sister two years ago.</p>
<p>It was summer before I went to my university. To celebrate the qualification that I got to pursue my master’s degree, my father decided to catch a fish in the nearby river and made a good square meal for me. </p>
<p>He got up very early that day and ate instant food. Then, he rode on his bike to go fishing. He finally came back in the afternoon with a 5-kilogram carp. My sister and I stared at the fish, bubbling with excitement. My father asked us how he should cook it for dinner. I preferred to grill it, but my sister wanted to eat a fish hotpot. The weather was scorching hot, so I thought that eating hotpot in our small dining hall would make us pour with sweat and uncomfortable, even though we had an air conditioner. Nonetheless, there’s no accounting for taste, my sister still insisted to serve it that way on a sweltering day. Trying to convince my younger sister that we should eat grilled fish was useless, so I flew into rage and asked my dad to cut the fish into two to make two dishes at the same time, one for grilled fish and another for fish hotpot. Finally, my dad said that it would be <strong>inappropriate</strong> to have a hotpot, so we had a barbeque that day. </p>
<p>Although I won the disagreement, I felt I was childish when I was <strong>lying</strong> on my bed. It was not necessary to argue with an eleven-year-old child. I should have <strong>compromised</strong> because I am the adult and the big brother. </p>

One day, one of my close friends told me that if I did that again, she would give up our relationship, too. From then on, I started to transforming my temper. So if I had a disagreement with someone, especially my friends, I would have calmed down firstly. Then I would try to analysis and see their points. Moreover, I would explain their points to them, which is a effective way to express that I had understand their viewpoints. Lastly, I would wholeheartedly reason with them.</p>

Firstly, we must stop criticising and accusing others, which always happens when facing disputes. Then, we should listen carefully to what others say and analyse their feelings and needs. Meanwhile, we need to express to them to check whether we understand their needs. If not, we need to reanalysis. Lastly, we need to find out what we feel and what we need others to do or not to do, then express these to the other side. In both principle and practice, these procedures are always possible and practical. </p>
<p>I would recommend this book to those who want to reach an agreement or compromise with others in a reasonable and friendly means. </p>

It’s necessary that parents should talk with children about respecting others, especially their teachers, before they go to school because children spend the most time with their parents. They usually, directly and indirectly, learn from their parents. If parents teach them or set good examples, they can cultivate the sense and habit of respecting their teachers.  On the other hand, it’s essential that people learn, from a young age, about respecting teachers. So primary schools also can make effort to help children develop habit of respecting teachers.</p>

They may have a disagreement when parents see their children, especially girls, wearing revealing clothes. In addition, some parents don’t like their children listening music or playing smartphones when study. Moreover, they think young generations don’t have a healthy lifestyle and lack some qualities. Youngsters like to stay up and get up late, eat junk foods. Some young people often give up when facing obstructs because they lack of persistence.</p>

<p>  Actually, I have been  staying indoors at my university because of the COVID-19 pandemic<code>/pænˈdem.ɪk/</code>. The last  time I went out was on Labour Day<code> /ˈleɪ.bə ˌdeɪ/</code>, specifically<code> /spəˈsɪf.ɪ.kəl.i/</code> on May 1st. My  friend,  who was also my roommate, invited me to go fishing and one of our classmates, who has not fished before, also came with us.</p>
<p>It was a day of clear skies and  unbroken sunshine with light wind. After eating breakfast, we rode a share-bike together and went to a nearby lake in our college<code>/ˈkɒl.ɪdʒ/</code>. We also took  with us our fishing tackles<code> /ˈtæk·əl/</code>. My classmate was bubbling<code> /ˈbʌb.əl/</code> with excitement because it was his first time to go fishing.</p>
<p>When we got there, we chose a tranquil<code> /ˈtræŋ.kwɪl/</code> spot. We adjusted our fishing rods<code> /rɒd</code> and started to catch fishes. In beginning, me and my friend were so engrossed<code> /ɪnˈɡrəʊst/</code> during the activity that we forgot to help our classmate. As a result, he was disappointed<code>/ˌdɪs.əˈpɔɪn.tɪd/</code> and upset, then he called my attention to ask for help. So, I stopped what I was doing and instructed him about the essential <strong>processes<code> /ˈprəʊ.ses/purouseseisi</code></strong>- the state of the fish, how it swallows<code> /ˈswɒl.əʊ/siwolousi</code> the food in the hook<code>/hʊk/</code>, and the correct position of the <strong>rod</strong>. After an hour,  he eventually picked up the procedures<code>/prəˈsiː.dʒər/posijesi</code> I taught him. When he got his first fish, he was blissfully<code> /ˈblɪs.fəl.i/buleisifelei</code> happy. At the end of the day, we got about 20 fishes.</p>
<p>It was a rewarding and fulfilling day because we were able to free ourselves from the hustle and bustle of studying. In addition, it was also a wonderful bonding<code> /ˈbɒn.dɪŋ/</code> opportunity for us. It was great to spend leisure<code>/ˈleʒ.ər/</code> time with friends. I loved kicking<code> /kɪk/keiking</code> back and at the same time <strong>experiencing</strong> the cool breeze and sunshine.   </p>

For instance, elderly usually likes to dance in the park. It is a healthy way for them to relax because it is a form of exercise. It can help stretch<code> /stretʃ/</code> their muscles when they dance along with the music. Moreover, some people choose to stroll at night along the road after dinner, which is also an easy way to help digestion<code> /daɪˈdʒes.tʃən/</code>. Besides when the evening falls, the whole city becomes a sea of lights. Walking while seeing this pleasant<code> /ˈplez.ənt/</code> scenery<code> /ˈsiː.nər.i/sinerui</code> at night relieves us from the stress and pressure.  Therefore, outside exercises not only improve our physical aspect<code>/ˈæs.pekt/asibaiketa</code> but also our mental health.   </p>

Those who like daring and dangerous activities tend to be adventurous<code>/ədˈven.tʃər.əs/edewenqieresi</code> and self-assured<code> /əˈʃɔːd/</code>. Also, they have the nerve<code> /nɜːv/</code> to challenge themselves so, these characteristics<code> /ˌkær.ək.təˈrɪs.tɪk/</code> may probably be a recipe<code> /ˈres.ɪ.pi/</code> for <strong>success</strong>. For example, if a person loves to do extremely<code> /ɪkˈstriːm.li/</code> perilous<code>/ˈper.əl.əs/</code>(dangerous)  sports such as paragliding<code>/ˈpær.əˌɡlaɪ.dɪŋ/</code>, edge walking and car racing without any hesitations<code>/ˌhez.ɪˈteɪ.ʃən/</code>,  would risk finding a solution how to deal and handle the situation and to win the game. However, the people who prefers a normal and safe ventures are less likely to develop a sense of control, since they depend on the idea that they can just follow those who are in charge. What I mean is, they would rather do easy tasks than challenging themselves to become competitive individuals.  Personally, they can all be successful, as long as they keep on trying.   </p>

People who earn a living can change their jobs when there are better opportunities, especially when they are offered competitive<code> /kəmˈpet.ɪ.tɪv/</code> salaries. This allows them to provide adequate<code>/ˈæd.ə.kwət/</code> needs for their family. In addition, those employees<code> /ɪmˈplɔɪ.iː/</code> who faces heavy workload on a daily basis would definitely<code>/ˈdef.ɪ.nət.li/</code> need to look for a new employer, who doesn’t require them to do demanding jobs. On the other hand, if the new working environment pressures<code>/ˈpreʃ.ər/</code> workers to do an overtime and menial<code> /ˈmiː.ni.əl/</code>, it would be best to keep the current role. Yet, you still need to consider your career growth and personal development. Therefore, it’s wise to list all pros and cons and weigh the possible outcomes.</p>

<p>Absolutely! However, young people should find a more reasonable and suitable ventures as much as possible. Some activities need specialised and critical instructions otherwise they can be dangerous, such as edge walking and cliff camping. Another thing is, their abilities have limitations therefore, it would be impossible for them to learn all undertakings that they come across with. It is best to concentrate on one activity at a time. However,  the child’s attention’s span is far different from an adult. There’s a  possibility that their focus will shift from one activity to another so, it would be helpful to train these individuals to stay centred on one subject before proceeding to another one. To sum it all up, we should just let them choose activities that they really like.   </p>

<p>I once missed an appointment with a friend because I used to be addicted to a computer game about four years ago.</p>
<p>One day in 2018, a friend asked me to study with her in the library. She thought I was good at mathematics and wanted me to help her with it. </p>
<p>I accepted and made a three o’clock with her. After lunch, my roommates invited me to play a popular online game and said I wouldn’t miss my appointment. However, we were so engrossed in the thrilling pictures that I forgot to check the time. It was already five o’clock when I realised I had an appointment. </p>
<p>When I got there, I found she was visibly disappointed. But she didn’t show her feelings because she prefers to bottle up her emotions. I was terribly sorry to be late. What I could do was use my action to acquire her forgiveness. I sat down and began to instruct her in mathematics.</p>
<p>After finishing two hours of study, we strolled on our campus. I tried to explain to her why I was late. </p>

<p>About two months ago, my tutor asked me to share my personal experience of postgraduate life on our campus with some freshmen in the same office as me. I think it’s meaningful.</p>
<p>One day in September, my tutor had a small conservation with me just at the beginning of the new school term. He praised what I had done and wanted me to give a small speech to those who just came to our department. I told my mentor I felt nervous because I was shy and solitary. In addition, I was afraid to talk to strangers, and I always eschewed it whenever possible. But my mentor encouraged me and said it was also an opportunity to build my confidence. </p>
<p>Before the speech, I still got a bit anxious. But as the speech went on, I became really confident. Firstly, I introduced myself and gave details about our office. I told these freshmen how to adapt to new life and cope with problems they would counter. Then I also shared my daily routine, preferences, and regrets. I told them it was better if they developed a habit, such as an exercise and reading. Exercise is beneficial to physical health and an excellent method to relieve stress and pressure. Finally, I also advised them to improve their English as early as possible, which was a regret I had. </p>
<p> They very much appreciated what I had shared with them. And I felt it was meaningful.</p>

<p>About one year ago, I searched papers regarding the recommendation system because my tutor advised me to do so.</p>
<p>After finishing my first year, I struggled with how to do research. Although I had spared much time in it, I didn’t do well. So I had a discussion with my tutor after our National holiday. He was very friendly and told me about the outline of the research. Then he recommended some books for beginners like me. He also gave me a website and told me to search for some articles.</p>
<p>The website is a paper database for researchers. Firstly, I used the recommendation system as a keyword to search. However, there were considerable results on the website, and I didn’t know which one I should read first. Then I consulted the book and filtered some articles which were too old or were seldom cited by people. I listed the ten highest-cited papers and downloaded them. I also searched for some latest recommendation system articles and downloaded them.</p>
<p>In addition, it took me a too long time to read papers. So I also checked the internet about how to read an article and take notes. </p>
<p>That was quite a fulfilling day. </p>

<p>About four months ago, I saw a lot of plastic waste in a short video when the president of our department gave a presentation about environmental problems in a small hall at our university. </p>
<p>In June, the student union held an activity about protecting the environment. Some friends and I together took part in this activity. Firstly, the president of our department delivered a small speech and showed us a short video. I saw many plastic bottles, bags, and boxes on the beach. What’s worse, I saw a turtle trapped by a plastic bag and a dead bird having plastic trash in its stomach. It’s unbelievable that lazy human behaviours mean disasters to these creatures. I thought those people should receive universal condemnation. </p>
<p>Then we were given a bag and began to collect litter on our campus. At the end of that day, we gathered and sold all the plastic bottles. </p>
<p>I thought it was meaningful and fulfilled. By attending this activity, I was much more aware of the importance of protecting our environment. We also wrote to local media and advised them to promote the importance of collecting and recycling bottles. In addition, we volunteered to go to local primary schools and educate pupils about not throwing garbage and caring for our global.</p>

<p>I have been studying English since Grade 3, and most of them are taught by Chinese people. However, I’d like to talk about the most impressive one I had on campus five years ago.</p>
<p>It was the first week of the new term, and we were about to have an English class. On the way to the classroom, I complained to my friends because I wouldn’t say I liked the tedious lectures the tutor read and asked a student to translate into Chinese. When we walked into the study hall, we found that our lecturer was expectedly a Chinese. However, he told us he was Chinese but born and lived in Canada. In addition, he was extremely humour, patient and approachable. To break the ice, he told us about his funny experience when he bought food in our student canteen. As the class went on, I became really confident and dared to communicate with him. He was not only an attentive audience but also an instructive guide. He encouraged us to improve our English and travel worldwide, by which we could broaden our horizons.</p>
<p>I was very comfortable and inspired by this different form of class, and this lesson inspired my determination to study abroad.</p>

<p>About a year ago, I tried to run a half-marathon in the playground and received a satisfactory score. </p>
<p>I reinitiated running when I started studying at Chongqing university two years ago. I go running about twice a week. An idea came to me on 18 July 2021, aka the half of that year. I wanted to challenge myself with a half-marathon. Actually, I didn’t have it in me as I usually run only 5 kilometres. It was quite difficult for me and might also be dangerous because I never received professional training. I would like to have a try. I would give up if I felt discomfort.</p>
<p>However, after running about 15 km, I was still in good condition and realized that it was pretty much in the bag. It was highly uneasy in the last six kilometres, but I insisted on running. Finally, I finished it which cost about two hours, which was a pretty excellent score in the amateur group. I couldn’t believe that I had made it. I felt fulfilled. </p>
<p>Then I posted a moment on WeChat and got serval likes and comments. My classmates and friends all admired what I had done. </p>
<p>However, I got pains in my legs the following week, and I had to eat some medicine to relieve myself.</p>

<p>I would like to talk about a constructive<code>/kənˈstrʌk.tɪv/</code> suggestion that my tutor<code>/ˈtʃuː.tər/</code> gave me when I was about to give up on my experiments<code> /ɪkˈsper.ɪ.mənt/</code>.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I was doing some experiments<code> /ɪkˈsper.ɪ.mənt/</code> to design an artificial intelligence program. However, the results were not ideal to publish online. I tried harder to do it multiple<code> /ˈmʌl.tɪ.pəl/ mouteipou</code> times, but the outputs was still not the one I had expected<code> /ɪkˈspek.tɪd/</code>. I dwelt<code>/dwel/duwailt</code> on the failure<code> /ˈfeɪ.ljər/</code> I had made and was about to quit.</p>
<p>My tutor noticed my struggles and decided to talk to me to find out my dilemma<code>/daɪˈlem.ə/</code>. He said a heap of words and the most impressive statement he told me was that I was one of his diligent<code>/ˈdɪl.ɪ.dʒənt/</code> and highly motivated<code> /ˈməʊ.tɪ.veɪ.tɪd/</code> students. Moreover, he said that if I would try harder, I could make progress.</p>
<p>After we talked about the problems that I was experiencing<code> /ɪkˈspɪə.ri.əns/</code>, his words made me realised<code>/ˈrɪəlaɪzd/</code> to do my best. He boosted<code> /buːst/busiteide</code> my confidence, so I reexamined<code>/ˌriː.ɪɡˈzæm.ɪn/ruieigezamin</code> my program and revised<code> /rɪˈvaɪz/</code> the core<code>/kɔːr/</code> code. I listed all the things that I had missed, so that I would be aware of them next time. I would never forget how he cheered me up when I was down. His words were inspiring which helped me to complete my tasks with more self-reliance<code>/rɪˈlaɪ.əns/</code>. I couldn’t have published my paper last July without his motivation<code>/ˌməʊ.tɪˈveɪ.ʃən/</code> at that time.</p>

<p>Answer structure: Reason + General Opinion + Personal Opinion +  Future  </p>
<p>There are many reasons behind this. Firstly, lack of sleep or poor routine<code> /ruːˈtiːn/</code> may be one of the causes<code>/kɔːz/kezeizi</code> why children are distracted<code> /dɪˈstræk.tɪd/</code>. Secondly, excessive<code> /ɪkˈses·ɪv/</code> screen<code> /skriːn/</code> time also affects<code>/əˈfekt/</code> their concentration<code>/ˌkɒn.sənˈtreɪ.ʃən/kangsenchuisen</code> since they are easily enthralled<code> /ɪnˈθrɔːl/insiroude</code> with the videos and images that they can see on the Internet. Lastly, if their diet is high in sugar and fat, it harms not only their health but also their ability to concentrate<code> /ˈkɒn.sən.treɪt/kangsenchuita</code>. They need to consume nutritious<code>/njuːˈtrɪʃ.əs/</code> foods to improve their mental capability<code> /ˌkeɪ.pəˈbɪl.ə.ti/</code>. Therefore, children should be taught a healthy lifestyle and eating habits to stay focused.</p>

<p>Answer structure: Opinion + Reason + Example+ Conclusion  </p>
<p>Absolutely! The constant<code>/ˈkɒn.stənt/kangsidenta</code> use of technology will shorten children’s attention span. Being excessively<code> /ekˈses.ɪv.li/aikesesiwulei</code> exposed to contents<code> /kənˈtent/</code> on smartphones, iPads, tablets like short videos, upbeat music and games, harms their concentration<code>/ˌkɒn.sənˈtreɪ.ʃən/kangsenchuisen</code>.

<p>Answer structure: Opinion + Example + Description + Example 2+  Description  </p>
<p>All kinds of jobs need to have an optimal<code> /ˈɒp.tɪ.məl/</code> level of concentration<code>/ˌkɒn.sənˈtreɪ.ʃən/kangsenchuisen</code>. I’d like to talk about my future job as an example. In designing an artificial intelligence program, I have to be laser<code>/ˈleɪ.zər/</code> focused, otherwise I would make some bugs in my codes and I can’t get the ideal results. I should focus on how to transform my idea and mathematical<code> /ˌmæθˈmæt.ɪ.kəl/</code> equations<code>/ɪˈkweɪ.ʒən/</code> into codes and check it thoroughly<code>/ˈθʌr.ə.li/seroulei</code> to have a desirable<code>/dɪˈzaɪə.rə.bəl/</code> outputs. Moreover, experts<code>/ˈek.spɜːt/ </code> who are responsible<code>/rɪˈspɒn.sə.bəl/</code> for the restoration<code> /ˌres.tərˈeɪ.ʃən/</code> of cultural<code>/ˈkʌl.tʃər.əl/ kaoqierou</code> relics<code>/ˈrel.ɪk/</code> must be particular with their work. They involves<code> /ɪnˈvɒlv/inwowu</code> repairing of ancient artefacts<code>/ˈɑː.tə.fækt/</code> such as paintings or portraits<code> /ˈpɔː.trət/</code>. If they will not pay more attention when reconditioning<code> /ˌriː.kənˈdɪʃ.ən/</code> these items, it can load to a serious damage of the objects.</p>

<p>Answer structure: Opinion + Reason + Example + conclusion</p>
<p>I agree that physical activity can improve one’s concentration<code>/ˌkɒn.sənˈtreɪ.ʃən/kangsenchuisen</code> however we should also have a healthy eating habit at the same time. This is because when we do regular<code> /ˈreɡ.jə.lər/re:giule</code> exercises, it alleviates<code> /əˈliː.vi.eɪt/</code> distractions and keeps us focus on one task. To be honest, running is one of my routine<code> /ruːˈtiːn/</code>. It helps me relieve<code> /rɪˈliːv/</code> all the pressure<code>/ˈpreʃ.ər/ </code> and stress that affects my mental health. As a result, it allows me to divert<code> /daɪˈvɜːt/</code> my attention from thinking negatively to a positive outlook in my study. Therefore, having a balance diet, healthy lifestyle together with professional<code>/prəˈfeʃ.ən.əl/</code> training may improve people’s ability to focus.</p>

For example, one obvious difference is that the most buildings in the city are higher than those in countryside. People come from different  place, even different nations, live in the same buildings. In contrast, houses in countryside tend to be below 3 stories and most time a family live in together. What’s more, most communities in the city, especially in the same building, are totally same, with bedrooms, kitchen, living room, toilet, and a balcony. However, houses in countryside tend to have different style, with a yard, a garden, a tree, a pet house or a livestock house. People live in the same neighbourhood may have different house style.</p>

Because there are more opportunities for education and occupation, more-perfect medical facilities, and convenient transportation in the contemporary.  Actually, I have been making an effort to leave the countryside for a descent and well-paid job. Maybe when I retire from my company, I will go back to the countryside to enjoy the tranquillity with my wife.</p>

In both these conditions, taking the elevator would be traumatically dangerous. And climbing stairs would take many times. Moreover, the food supply in city rely on transporting. If transportation is down because of some reason, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, those residents who are dangerously low in food stores would suffer from starving.  In addition, the population density in the cities are two high, when accidents happen, there may be more people get hurted.</p>

I haven’t put close attention on this problem since I still studying in the college and don’t have my own house. However, personally, it may will take a considerable amount of money to decorate a house from scratch. Everything needs money, the furniture, the appliance, the Internet, the workers. If you want live in a more modern house, with a central control system to intelligently make daily life more easy, it will take extra money to buy the system.</p>

<p>I’d like to talk about an online broadcast that I am really into. Its name is the Chinese Talk Show Conference, a roast competition hosted by Tencent Video. </p>
<p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a time when I couldn’t leave my house and had to stay at home every day. That life was dull and monotonous. Some day, my friend who actually lives in another city invited me to watch an interesting show together through Zoom. </p>
<p>It was more like a comedy show. Everyone, from amateurs to celebrities, as long as they have a talent for comedy and the nerve to deliver a small free-style speech in front of audiences, could attend this conference. </p>
<p>What gave me impressive memory was an American named Jesse Appell. He considered himself a Chinese Comedian since he had lived in Beijing for about seven years and learned Chinese, especially learned Chinese comic cross-talk from a Chinese master.  </p>
<p>He was good at performing stand-up comedy, and his Chinese was incredibly fluent. To break the ice,  he started with the Chinese people’s incredible reactions when they heard he spoke fluent Chinese. Then he compared Chinese and Western eating habits by giving examples of how people eat pizzas in China and how people eat steamed stuffed buns in the USA. Lastly, he ended his performance with his dad’s strange reaction to hearing him answer phones with a Chinese-style start.</p>
<p> (Just as the saying goes, “Comedy is tragedy plus time”, they turn their embarrassed or engaging experience into comedy scripts, then have a speech and laugh it off.) I appreciate that they have shown great courage and confidence in front of audiences. I usually don’t dare to speak with strangers, especially in public. After watching these shows, I am trying to build my confidence and strengthen my courage to speak. </p>

They tend to be emotional and sensitive. Therefore, they have a taste for watching different types of people fall in love, especially those backgrounds that are totally distinctive. On the other hand, most males are very attached to TV series based on history, war, or science fiction since they love shocking and thrilling content. In addition, children have a liking for animation and animal shows since those contents are interesting with funny story or cute animals. </p>
<h4 id="Part-3-Do-people-in-your-country-like-to-watch-foreign-TV-programs"><a href="#Part-3-Do-people-in-your-country-like-to-watch-foreign-TV-programs" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 - Do  people in your country like to watch foreign TV programs?"></a>Part 3 - Do  people in your country like to watch foreign TV programs?</h4><p>Certainly. It is a real pleasure and entertainment for many Chinese people to watch foreign TV series since it’s a good chance and opportunity for most people who rarely go abroad to learn about the western cultural. Most people would never have the chance to travel or live in other countries, however, they could experience foreign life by watching their popular shows.  For most Chinese, the earliest foreign TV series must to be Friends and The Big Bang Theory, and I am one of them. We are curious about the life in foreign country. We also are impressed by adorable Sheldon and approachable Leonard. In addition, we could learn knowledge that could not learn from textbooks. For example, Fishing, Man vs. Wild, Sex Education.  </p>
<h4 id="Part-3-What’s-the-benefit-of-letting-kids-watch-animal-videos-than-visiting-zoos"><a href="#Part-3-What’s-the-benefit-of-letting-kids-watch-animal-videos-than-visiting-zoos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 - What’s  the benefit of letting kids watch animal videos than visiting zoos?"></a>Part 3 - What’s  the benefit of letting kids watch animal videos than visiting zoos?</h4><p>Personally, watching animal videos is more vivid and real than visiting zoos, which is beneficial for children to learn the real wild animal. Although animals in zoos tend to have a longer life span with the protection provided by zoos against predators and disease, most of them lose their natural behaviours. In addition, most zoos are designed for entertainment and sighting and sometimes couldn’t provide sufficient space for animals. Seeing their miserable environment in zoos is cruel. On the other hand, animal videos could be made in the wild life or wild conservation areas where animals are naturally born and developed. Watching these videos contributes to children’s better knowledge about animals.</p>

The main reason is that education sector don’t allow schools and teachers to do so since they only consider traditional teaching methods effective and productive. What’s more, most classrooms don’t equip with multi-media players and screens, especially in rural area. Even teachers could show students educational movies, they need to borrow or rent players, which increase the cost and decrease the chance that play videos for students. In addition, some teachers hold the view that students have limited study time in school and it’s wise to use time reasonably, especially for those who will attend College Entrance Exam.</p>

<p>I have met many casual acquaintances in my life and would like to talk about the most impressive one. She is my friend’s cousin, Miss Peng, a master’s degree candidate in France.</p>
<p>I first met her at my friend’s birthday party last summer. She had an hourglass figure and long, sleek, and jet-black hair. She dressed in gorgeous Han Chinese clothing. She performed a western song at the party on a traditional Chinese instrument-guzheng, a Chinese zither. </p>
<p>I was impressed by her ability to transform a Western song to play on the guzheng, which really gave me pleasure and held my attention. I could not envision that “See you again” could be performed that way. A very distinctive tone, many glides, fingerings, and vibrato of guzheng were used to express emotions. They are very well integrated. That was amazingly rocking, and she must be super familiar with this song and good at music. And I think she was an immensely talented young girl. I was overwhelmed with emotions when I heard the lovely sound. </p>
<p>I had no chance to make friends with her because she left the party early. It was disappointing. I really want to know more about her talent.</p>

<p>I had about 20 classmates in my elementary school, and the one impressive person who stuck in my mind was a transfer student in grade 4. She had a catchy name-Yang Yingying, which was easy to remember. She had long, sleek, and jet-black hair. She was approachable, having a radiant smile. </p>
<p>When she transferred to my primary school, my teacher made me her deskmate. Actually, in the beginning, we didn’t talk too much. One day, our teacher didn’t carry her piano to the classroom as usual in the music class. Surprisingly, she brought a rectangular instrument and told us that Yingying would play it for us. We all didn’t see it before and were curious about it. She made an introduction for it - a traditional Chinese instrument -guzheng-also called a Chinese zither. She played a song named “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” for us. The lovely sound and her elegant figure playing guzheng gave me pleasure and held my attention. </p>
<p>In my childhood, we seldom had a chance to learn about an instrument because most of our parents were farmers; I was shocked by her ability to play guzheng. I thought she was an immensely talented young girl.</p>
